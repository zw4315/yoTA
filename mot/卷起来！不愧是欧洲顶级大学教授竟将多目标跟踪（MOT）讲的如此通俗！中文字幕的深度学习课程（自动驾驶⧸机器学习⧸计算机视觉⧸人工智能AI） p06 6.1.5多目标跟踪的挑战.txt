[0.00s -> 7.00s]  Hi. In this video, we're going to give an overview of the challenges that we face in multiple object tracking.
[7.00s -> 14.00s]  We can illustrate the challenges in MOT by considering an example involving an autonomous vehicle that is driving along a road.
[14.00s -> 19.00s]  The vehicle has a sensor with a field of view illustrated by this circle segment.
[19.00s -> 23.00s]  So to begin with, we have an unknown number of objects in the field of view.
[23.00s -> 29.00s]  So in this particular example, we have four pedestrians in the field of view, two on each side of the road,
[29.00s -> 31.00s]  and there are also two cars.
[31.00s -> 37.00s]  And in addition to this, that we don't know the number of objects, we also don't know the states of the object,
[37.00s -> 40.00s]  so where they are located and where they are going.
[40.00s -> 47.00s]  And you should know that MOT is often restricted to tracking the objects that are inside the field of view of the sensors.
[47.00s -> 50.00s]  And the reason for this is fairly obvious.
[50.00s -> 53.00s]  We cannot track an object if we cannot detect it.
[53.00s -> 58.00s]  And naturally, we can only detect objects that are inside the field of view.
[58.00s -> 64.00s]  To make things even more complicated, we must take into account that objects move around.
[64.00s -> 67.00s]  They move in different directions with different speeds.
[67.00s -> 70.00s]  Some objects are moving straight ahead, other objects are turning.
[70.00s -> 75.00s]  So in this example, we've illustrated this movement by these dashed arrows.
[75.00s -> 82.00s]  And because the objects move, some of them disappear from the field of view, they leave the field of view.
[82.00s -> 90.00s]  And in this example, we've highlighted with a red ellipsis one of the cars and one of the pedestrians that are about to leave the field of view.
[90.00s -> 96.00s]  And of course, objects might also appear in the field of view, meaning that they enter the field of view.
[96.00s -> 101.00s]  So here we have two pedestrians and one car that are about to enter the field of view.
[101.00s -> 110.00s]  And in target tracking literature, object appearance and object disappearance is often referred to as object birth and object death, respectively.
[110.00s -> 118.00s]  So if you come across object birth and death in some tracking literature, you should know that it just refers to objects appearing and disappearing.
[118.00s -> 122.00s]  It does not refer to any actual birth or death.
[122.00s -> 127.00s]  And we are also challenged by the fact that sometimes objects occlude other objects.
[127.00s -> 136.00s]  In this example, we have a pedestrian, again highlighted by red ellipses, that is from the sensor's point of view, hidden behind the car.
[136.00s -> 140.00s]  And because the pedestrian is hidden or occluded, it cannot be detected.
[140.00s -> 146.00s]  And lastly, a general challenge in MOT is that the detectors that we employ are imperfect.
[146.00s -> 152.00s]  And this means that they are susceptible to two kinds of errors, missed detections and false detections.
[152.00s -> 155.00s]  And we will learn more about this next.
