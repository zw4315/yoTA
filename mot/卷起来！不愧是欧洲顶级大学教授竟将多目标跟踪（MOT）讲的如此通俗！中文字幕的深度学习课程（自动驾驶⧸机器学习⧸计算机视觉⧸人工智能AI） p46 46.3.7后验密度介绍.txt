[0.00s -> 6.00s]  Hi, we've previously talked about the prior in n-object tracking as well as the measurement likelihood.
[6.00s -> 11.50s]  Now we're going to have a look at what the base posterior density is in n-object tracking.
[11.50s -> 17.50s]  To get the posterior density, we start with a prior for n objects and the measurement likelihood.
[17.50s -> 22.50s]  The base posterior is proportional to the multiplication of the likelihood and the prior.
[22.50s -> 27.50s]  And what we want to arrive at is an expression for what this base posterior is.
[27.50s -> 30.50s]  And we have already done this for single object tracking.
[30.50s -> 35.50s]  In single object tracking, similarly, we have a prior and we have a likelihood,
[35.50s -> 39.50s]  and the base posterior is proportional to the product of the two.
[39.50s -> 46.50s]  We also saw earlier that the structure of the base posterior is a sum over data associations,
[46.50s -> 51.50s]  where we have the posterior density of the single object state given the measurements
[51.50s -> 57.50s]  and the association theta multiplied by the probability of the data association.
[57.50s -> 66.50s]  And for tracking n objects, we're going to see that we have the same type of structure for the posterior density.
[66.50s -> 71.50s]  To arrive at an expression for the posterior density in n-object tracking,
[71.50s -> 76.50s]  we're going to start by having a look at the posterior density for a unimodal prior.
[76.50s -> 82.50s]  After that, we will derive the expression for the posterior when the prior is a mixture density.
[82.50s -> 89.50s]  And we will see that the posterior is proportional to the sum over the prior hypothesis H,
[89.50s -> 95.50s]  a sum over the data associations, and then for each hypothesis and each association,
[95.50s -> 102.50s]  we have a weight and a posterior density conditioned on the hypothesis and the association.
[102.50s -> 109.50s]  And lastly, from all of this, we will arrive at a general expression for the posterior density at time K,
[109.50s -> 113.50s]  given measurements up to and including time K.
[113.50s -> 118.50s]  And just like in single object tracking, we will have a sum over data association sequences
[118.50s -> 121.50s]  from the first time step to the current time step.
[121.50s -> 125.50s]  We will have a weight for each data association sequence
[125.50s -> 129.50s]  and a density conditioned on the data association sequence.
