[0.00s -> 5.92s]  Okay, in this short video, we're going to see how we can model the initial prior density
[5.92s -> 8.40s]  in n-object tracking.
[8.40s -> 14.26s]  So what we need is a prior density for the n objects, a prior at time zero for the
[14.26s -> 20.10s]  object states x1, x2, and all the way to xn.
[20.10s -> 24.74s]  And we're going to model this initial prior using an independence assumption.
[24.74s -> 30.34s]  So we need to quickly remind ourselves of what independent random variables mean.
[30.34s -> 38.52s]  If we have n random variables, xi, then they're independent if their joint density factorizes,
[38.52s -> 44.34s]  meaning that we can describe the joint density as a product of densities for each individual
[44.34s -> 47.00s]  variable, just like we've done here.
[47.00s -> 55.44s]  A typical assumption in object tracking is that initially the object states are independent.
[55.44s -> 60.34s]  And as we have discussed earlier in this course, multiple object tracking requires assumed
[60.34s -> 61.96s]  density filtering.
[61.96s -> 67.28s]  So we need to assume some density type for the object states using this initial
[67.28s -> 68.92s]  prior.
[68.92s -> 73.12s]  And as we've also mentioned earlier in the course, Gaussian densities is a very common
[73.12s -> 74.28s]  assumption.
[74.28s -> 79.48s]  So if we assume Gaussian densities, then the initial prior at time zero is a product
[79.48s -> 87.24s]  of Gaussian densities with some mean vectors mu i and covariance matrices p i.
[87.24s -> 92.16s]  Somewhat less common in practice is to have an initial prior that is a mixture density,
[92.16s -> 94.44s]  like we see here.
[94.44s -> 100.38s]  You should note that in this case, for each mixture component, the objects are independent.
[100.38s -> 107.94s]  And again, given that we have assumed density filtering or require so in MOT, if we, for
[107.94s -> 113.46s]  example, assume Gaussian densities, then the initial prior would be a weighted mixture
[113.46s -> 116.82s]  of independent Gaussians for each object.
[116.82s -> 122.50s]  Okay, so that's how the initial prior density typically is modeled in n-object tracking.
[122.50s -> 125.34s]  We assume that the initial density is independent.
