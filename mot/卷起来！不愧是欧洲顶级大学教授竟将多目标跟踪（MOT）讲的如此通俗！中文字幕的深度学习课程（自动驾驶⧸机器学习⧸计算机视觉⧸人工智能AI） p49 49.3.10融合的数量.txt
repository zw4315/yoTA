[0.00s -> 10.74s]  Previously, we saw that in n-object tracking, the posterior density is a mixture density,
[10.74s -> 15.60s]  and the number of mixture components increases due to the unknown data association.
[15.60s -> 18.84s]  In single-object tracking, we had the same situation.
[18.84s -> 24.90s]  The number of mixture components increases, and the increase was a factor mk plus one
[24.90s -> 26.08s]  in each time step.
[26.32s -> 30.78s]  So in this part, we're going to have a look at what the corresponding number is for tracking
[30.78s -> 32.28s]  a known number of objects.
[32.28s -> 37.60s]  So basically, how fast does the number of mixture components in the posterior density
[37.60s -> 38.92s]  increase?
[38.92s -> 43.86s]  And to do so, as a first step, we will have a look at how many possible data associations
[43.86s -> 48.56s]  there are for some number of objects and some number of measurements.
[48.56s -> 52.12s]  So we have m measurements and n objects.
[52.12s -> 58.14s]  Then the number of measurements associated to objects, mo, will be an integer between zero
[58.14s -> 60.08s]  and the minimum of m and n.
[60.08s -> 64.84s]  And we have to take the minimum here, because trivially, we can't associate more than
[64.84s -> 69.56s]  m measurements, and we cannot associate two more than n objects.
[69.56s -> 74.10s]  So whichever of these is the smallest, that gives us the limit.
[74.10s -> 79.64s]  So we will have mo object detections, meaning that mo objects are detected.
[79.64s -> 86.24s]  And the number of ways we can choose mo objects from n objects is given by the binomial coefficient
[86.24s -> 88.54s]  n over mo.
[88.54s -> 94.48s]  And similarly, the number of ways which we can choose mo measurements from m measurements
[94.48s -> 99.40s]  is given by the binomial coefficient m over mo.
[99.40s -> 104.88s]  And then the number of ways which we can assign the selected detections to the selected
[104.88s -> 108.14s]  objects is given by mo factorial.
[108.14s -> 115.18s]  And this gives us the total number of data associations here denoted na of m comma n,
[115.18s -> 120.20s]  which is a sum over mo from zero to the minimum of m and n.
[120.20s -> 125.20s]  And for each mo, we multiply the number of ways to select objects, the number of
[125.20s -> 130.54s]  ways to select detections, and the number of ways to associate the selected objects
[130.54s -> 132.82s]  and the selected detections.
[132.82s -> 138.32s]  So we can verify that this expression is correct when we have just a single object.
[138.32s -> 143.86s]  So we compute na of m comma n for n equal to one.
[143.86s -> 148.82s]  We get the binomial coefficient one over zero times the binomial coefficient m over
[148.82s -> 151.82s]  zero times zero factorial.
[151.82s -> 158.26s]  And if m is larger than zero, we also get the binomial coefficient one over one times
[158.26s -> 162.56s]  the binomial coefficient m over one times one factorial.
[162.56s -> 168.84s]  And as expected, this evaluates to one plus m, so one plus the number of measurements.
[168.84s -> 172.80s]  And this is exactly the expression we had in single object tracking.
[172.80s -> 178.86s]  We have one misdetection association, and then there are m different measurement associations.
[178.86s -> 183.90s]  If we compute this number of associations for some different combinations of number
[183.90s -> 188.48s]  of objects and number of measurements, we get the table shown here.
[188.48s -> 194.22s]  So as you can see in this table, the number of valid associations increases very rapidly
[194.22s -> 198.02s]  as the number of objects and the number of measurements increases.
[198.02s -> 204.76s]  For example, if we have four objects and four measurements, there are 209 valid associations.
[204.76s -> 209.06s]  But if we have twice the amount of objects and twice the amount of measurements, eight
[209.06s -> 214.28s]  each, then we have almost one and a half million valid associations.
[214.28s -> 220.82s]  So we understand that it becomes computationally intractable to consider all possible associations.
[220.82s -> 225.72s]  And in any practical tracking algorithm, we have to make approximations.
[225.72s -> 232.84s]  The number of mixture components in the posterior density at time k is given by n o multiplied
[232.84s -> 238.14s]  by the product over the number of possible data associations from the first time step
[238.14s -> 240.68s]  to the current time step k.
[240.72s -> 246.00s]  And here n o is the number of mixture components in the initial prior density.
[246.00s -> 251.50s]  And typically this number is equal to one, although it is possible to have a larger
[251.50s -> 254.52s]  number of initial mixture components.
[254.52s -> 259.12s]  So we can compare this to the expression for tracking a single object, which is the
[259.12s -> 265.20s]  number of initial mixture components times the product of one plus the number of measurements.
[265.20s -> 270.44s]  And we realized that when we have multiple objects, this number of mixture components
[270.44s -> 273.08s]  increases much faster.
[273.08s -> 278.38s]  So let's consider an example in which we have a single initial mixture component and three
[278.38s -> 282.94s]  time steps with three, five, and four measurements respectively.
[282.94s -> 288.68s]  If we have a single object, the posterior density has 120 mixture components at time
[288.68s -> 289.86s]  three.
[289.86s -> 296.84s]  If we have two objects, the posterior density instead has 8,463 mixture components at time
[296.84s -> 298.16s]  three.
[298.16s -> 303.32s]  And if we have three objects, then at time three, the posterior density has more than
[303.32s -> 306.44s]  300,000 mixture components.
[306.44s -> 311.68s]  So again, this clearly illustrates that the number of data association combinations,
[311.68s -> 317.20s]  in other words, the number of mixture components, it increases very rapidly as the number
[317.20s -> 319.16s]  of objects increases.
[319.16s -> 323.68s]  So to summarize this, we learned that the number of data associations when we have m
[323.68s -> 328.30s]  measurements and n objects is given by this expression.
[328.30s -> 335.48s]  And it follows that the number of mixture components in the posterior is given by this
[335.48s -> 337.12s]  expression.
[337.12s -> 342.48s]  And clearly we saw that the number of mixture components increases very fast.
[342.48s -> 348.72s]  And we will see later how computationally tractable tracking algorithms require approximations
[348.72s -> 352.36s]  to the data association and what those approximations are.
