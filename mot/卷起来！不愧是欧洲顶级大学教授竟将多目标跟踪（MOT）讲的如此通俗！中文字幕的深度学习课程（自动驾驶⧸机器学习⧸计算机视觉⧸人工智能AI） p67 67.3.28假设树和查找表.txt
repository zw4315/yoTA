[0.00s -> 6.56s]  Hi, in this video we will introduce what the local hypothesis trees and the global lookup table are.
[6.56s -> 11.68s]  So we have MHT with local hypotheses and a table for the global hypotheses.
[12.24s -> 19.28s]  The local hypotheses are sometimes called tracks and this explains the name track-oriented MHT.
[19.28s -> 23.92s]  We have earlier seen the definitions of the number of global hypotheses,
[23.92s -> 29.12s]  calligraphic H, and the number of local hypotheses, calligraphic HI.
[29.76s -> 36.72s]  In track-oriented MHT, for each object we have a hypothesis tree where each leaf corresponds to
[36.72s -> 43.20s]  a local hypothesis. So in other words, an association sequence for the object. For each leaf
[43.20s -> 49.28s]  we then have the corresponding posterior density. In other words, the density for the object given
[49.28s -> 56.32s]  the measurements and the association sequence. So at time K the hypothesis tree for object I
[56.32s -> 64.40s]  has HI leaves. The global hypotheses are stored implicitly using a lookup table denoted
[64.40s -> 71.76s]  blackboard H. This can for example be a matrix where the element at row H and column I
[71.76s -> 78.16s]  points out which local hypothesis for object I is included in the global hypothesis H.
[78.80s -> 84.64s]  At time K there are age-global hypotheses in the lookup table. So assuming the lookup table is
[84.64s -> 90.88s]  a matrix like here, this means that it has calligraphic age rows. Let's take an example
[90.88s -> 96.48s]  where we have three time steps. At time one there are two measurements. So for an object
[96.48s -> 102.88s]  this gives us three local hypotheses. One for misdetection, one for association to
[102.88s -> 108.64s]  measurement one, and one for association to measurement two. So on the right we have the
[108.64s -> 115.84s]  hypothesis tree. From the square root node at time one there are three branches with circular
[115.84s -> 122.00s]  leaf nodes, one for each possible association. So along each branch we have written the
[122.00s -> 129.52s]  corresponding association. So we have theta i equal to zero, theta i equal to one, and so on.
[129.52s -> 135.28s]  And inside each node we have also written the corresponding association. So from left to right
[135.28s -> 141.20s]  we have no measurement, measurement one, measurement two. At time two there is no
[141.20s -> 146.48s]  measurement. So there is only one way to associate it, and that is a misdetection. So
[146.48s -> 153.28s]  we get that each branch is extended to time two. So now if we go from the root node along
[153.28s -> 160.08s]  each possible path to a leaf node we get the sequence of associations. So from left we have
[160.08s -> 166.40s]  misdetection followed by misdetection, then we have association to measurement one followed by
[166.40s -> 172.08s]  misdetection, and lastly association to measurement two followed by misdetection.
[172.72s -> 178.88s]  At time three there is one measurement, and this can be associated in two ways to the object.
[178.88s -> 185.60s]  Either misdetection or detection. So therefore each leaf node at time two is given two branches
[185.60s -> 191.44s]  that correspond to these two associations. So at time three we have a local hypothesis tree
[192.00s -> 198.64s]  with six leaf nodes, and they correspond to six local hypotheses. To get the corresponding data
[198.64s -> 204.24s]  association sequences for the local hypotheses we just have to follow along the branches from the
[204.24s -> 210.24s]  root node to the leaf node. So this is how a local hypothesis tree works. Next we will have
[210.24s -> 215.44s]  a look at an example with two objects and see what the global lookup table is. To make the
[215.44s -> 222.08s]  illustrations of the hypothesis trees a bit less cluttered we will not print out the associations
[222.08s -> 229.36s]  theta. Instead we're just going to print out the associations inside the nodes. To illustrate
[229.36s -> 235.28s]  we're going to use the same example that we used to illustrate the local and global hypotheses. So
[235.28s -> 241.04s]  we have two objects and at both times one and times two there is a single measurement. We have
[241.04s -> 247.92s]  an initial prior which in the hypothesis trees is represented by the square root nodes. At time
[247.92s -> 254.64s]  one we get one measurement. So each hypothesis tree has two leaf nodes. The posterior density
[254.64s -> 260.16s]  has three different global hypotheses and we're going to store these in the lookup table
[260.16s -> 267.44s]  on the right. In the first global hypothesis neither object is detected. So for simplicity
[267.44s -> 273.44s]  the local hypotheses are indexed from left to right in this illustration. So in the lookup table
[273.44s -> 280.48s]  the first hypothesis therefore points to local hypotheses one and one. Next we have association
[280.48s -> 288.72s]  to object two. So the lookup table then points to local hypotheses one and two. So we get one and
[288.72s -> 294.96s]  two. And lastly we have association to object one and the lookup table then points to local
[294.96s -> 302.00s]  hypotheses two and one. So we get two and one. At time two there is one more measurement. So
[302.00s -> 308.64s]  each leaf node at time one gets two branches to time two. One for missed detection and one for
[308.64s -> 316.24s]  detection. There are nine global hypotheses in the posterior at time two illustrated here on the left.
[316.24s -> 322.40s]  If we number them one to nine from left to right and top to bottom they are encoded in
[322.40s -> 327.76s]  the lookup table as follows. So if you would like to verify that these are indeed the nine
[327.76s -> 334.56s]  global hypotheses you can pause the video now and do so. But this is how the local hypothesis
[334.56s -> 341.68s]  trees and the global lookup table works. We store each local hypothesis just once and then the global
[341.68s -> 347.76s]  lookup table tells us how these hypotheses are combined. And you should note that for both
[347.76s -> 355.04s]  objects for example local hypothesis one is included in four different global hypotheses.
[355.04s -> 360.16s]  So we save some memory and some computations by only computing and storing it once.
