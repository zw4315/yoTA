[0.00s -> 4.74s]  Hi, in this video we're going to have a look at the independence assumptions that we made
[4.74s -> 8.74s]  in the modeling and how they affect the an-object density.
[8.74s -> 12.52s]  In the modeling, we made several independence assumptions.
[12.52s -> 17.98s]  The initial prior is independent, the measurements are independent, and the object motion is
[17.98s -> 19.36s]  independent.
[19.36s -> 24.58s]  So a relevant question then is, do all these assumptions mean that the object states
[24.58s -> 26.04s]  are independent?
[26.04s -> 31.86s]  And the answer, perhaps a bit surprisingly, is that actually the object states are not
[31.86s -> 35.90s]  independent, at least not in the general case.
[35.90s -> 42.86s]  We have seen that we have mixtures that correspond to sequences of an-object data associations.
[42.86s -> 50.06s]  Now if we condition on a specific data association hypothesis, then we see that the object states
[50.06s -> 56.28s]  are actually independent, because conditioned on the hypothesis, the an-object density is
[56.28s -> 60.30s]  a product of the individual densities for each object.
[60.30s -> 63.48s]  However, this is for a given hypothesis.
[63.48s -> 69.10s]  For the objects to be independent, we have to consider the full mixture density.
[69.10s -> 74.94s]  If the objects were to be independent, then we should be able to factorize the an-object
[74.94s -> 78.02s]  density into a product for each object.
[78.02s -> 84.10s]  So the question is, can we, in the general case, describe the an-object posterior as
[84.10s -> 90.42s]  a product of mixture densities for each object, as written here on the right?
[90.42s -> 92.06s]  And the answer is no.
[92.06s -> 96.50s]  In the general case, the mixture densities cannot be factorized.
[96.50s -> 101.14s]  However, there are tracking algorithms that are exceptions to this.
[101.14s -> 107.96s]  For example, global nearest neighbor, or GNN filter, and joint probabilistic data association,
[107.96s -> 109.78s]  or JPDA filter.
[109.78s -> 116.02s]  Both of these tracking algorithms approximate the posterior an-object density, such that
[116.02s -> 118.58s]  the objects are actually independent.
[118.58s -> 121.62s]  And we will learn more about these tracking algorithms later.
