[0.00s -> 8.20s]  In this video, we're going to have a look at the number of hypotheses in hypothesis-oriented
[8.20s -> 11.92s]  MHT, both global hypotheses and local hypotheses.
[11.92s -> 16.76s]  And this will then lead us to the second variant of MHT, which is called track-oriented.
[16.76s -> 22.64s]  To begin with, we need to explain what we mean by global hypotheses and local hypotheses.
[22.64s -> 28.18s]  A global hypothesis is for all n objects and corresponds to an association sequence
[28.18s -> 31.46s]  theta from the first time step to time k.
[31.46s -> 36.62s]  If we assume that we start with a single initial global hypothesis, then the number of global
[36.62s -> 42.10s]  hypotheses in the posterior density at time k is given by the product of the number of
[42.10s -> 45.50s]  associations from time 1 to time k.
[45.50s -> 51.10s]  A local hypothesis is for a single object and corresponds to an association sequence
[51.10s -> 56.30s]  theta i, which is for that particular object, again from the first time step to time
[56.30s -> 57.30s]  step k.
[57.34s -> 62.62s]  Assuming that the initial global hypothesis has a single local hypothesis for each object,
[62.62s -> 69.02s]  then the number of local hypotheses, calligraphic H with a super index i, is given by the product
[69.02s -> 71.50s]  of the number of measurements plus 1.
[71.50s -> 76.30s]  We can study the number of global and local hypotheses using an example.
[76.30s -> 79.02s]  Let there be two objects with one dimensional state.
[79.02s -> 83.58s]  We start with an initial prior at time 0 with one global hypothesis.
[83.58s -> 86.98s]  For each object, we have one local hypothesis.
[86.98s -> 92.34s]  The local hypotheses are illustrated on the left here in blue and orange.
[92.34s -> 95.02s]  At time 1, we have a single detection.
[95.02s -> 99.58s]  There are three ways to associate this detection, which gives us a posterior at time
[99.58s -> 101.74s]  1 with three global hypotheses.
[101.74s -> 104.56s]  These three are illustrated here in the middle.
[104.56s -> 109.22s]  On the top, we have that the measurement was associated as clutter, illustrated by
[109.22s -> 110.56s]  the white circle.
[110.56s -> 114.98s]  In the middle, we have the association to the second object shown in orange, and the
[114.98s -> 118.62s]  association is illustrated by coloring the detection orange.
[118.62s -> 122.86s]  And on the bottom, we have the association to the first object in blue.
[122.86s -> 128.50s]  In this posterior, we see that for each object, we actually have only two local hypotheses,
[128.50s -> 131.68s]  which correspond to misdetection and detection.
[131.68s -> 137.74s]  For object 1 in blue, it is misdetected in the first two global hypotheses, detected
[137.74s -> 143.56s]  in the third, and the second object is misdetected in the first and third, and detected in
[143.60s -> 145.56s]  the second global hypothesis.
[145.56s -> 148.68s]  At time 2, we have another single detection.
[148.68s -> 151.68s]  So again, we have three possible data associations.
[151.68s -> 158.28s]  And since we had three hypotheses at time 1, we get 3 times 3 equal to 9 hypotheses
[158.28s -> 159.44s]  at time 2.
[159.44s -> 165.56s]  We have illustrated these nine hypotheses such that each row contains hypotheses that are
[165.56s -> 170.16s]  descendants of the same row in illustration at time 1.
[170.16s -> 175.24s]  So in the top row on the right here, we have three global hypotheses that result from
[175.24s -> 181.52s]  updating the first global hypothesis at time 1, which was illustrated at the top, and
[181.52s -> 182.52s]  so on.
[182.52s -> 187.16s]  If we study the nine global hypotheses at time 2, we can see that we actually have
[187.16s -> 191.24s]  just four unique local hypotheses for each object.
[191.24s -> 196.84s]  For example, if we look at the four global hypotheses in the top left corner, then
[196.84s -> 203.48s]  we see that for object 1, colored in blue, we have the same local hypothesis, which results
[203.48s -> 210.28s]  from the association sequence misdetection at time 1 and misdetection at time 2.
[210.28s -> 217.48s]  So we can conclude that some of the local hypotheses occur in multiple global hypotheses.
[217.48s -> 224.00s]  Here we have studied the exact posterior density for a simple example, but often this holds
[224.00s -> 228.00s]  also for the MHT density approximation.
[228.00s -> 232.32s]  Some local hypotheses occur in multiple global hypotheses.
[232.32s -> 236.36s]  So what does all of this mean for hypothesis-oriented MHT?
[236.36s -> 241.66s]  Well, we have that each global hypothesis is represented independently of the other
[241.66s -> 245.32s]  hypotheses in hypothesis-oriented MHT.
[245.32s -> 251.24s]  And this means that identical local hypotheses will be represented multiple times.
[251.24s -> 255.44s]  And this is inefficient, both in terms of memory, but also in terms of the amount of
[255.44s -> 258.04s]  computations that we need to do.
[258.04s -> 263.56s]  More efficient would be to have a single copy of each unique local hypothesis, and
[263.56s -> 268.68s]  then keep a so-called lookup table for the global hypotheses, which tells us which
[268.68s -> 273.40s]  local hypotheses are included in the different global hypotheses.
[273.40s -> 277.78s]  And as a matter of fact, such implementations can be found in object tracking literature
[277.78s -> 280.60s]  and are called track-oriented MHT.
[280.60s -> 283.68s]  So next, we will learn more about track-oriented MHT.
