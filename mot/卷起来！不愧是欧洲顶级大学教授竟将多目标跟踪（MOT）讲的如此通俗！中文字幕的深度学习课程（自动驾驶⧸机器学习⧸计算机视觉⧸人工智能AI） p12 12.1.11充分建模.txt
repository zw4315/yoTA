[0.00s -> 5.60s]  There are many different ways that we can model the motion and model the measurement.
[5.60s -> 9.98s]  And it's important to know that in multiple object tracking, these models don't need
[9.98s -> 11.38s]  to be perfect.
[11.38s -> 16.68s]  The models should instead be sufficiently accurate and also have a reasonable complexity.
[16.68s -> 21.32s]  So what this means is that we would like to have high quality object estimates, but
[21.32s -> 26.28s]  we want to obtain these estimates at a reasonable computational cost.
[26.28s -> 31.82s]  So we need to find a balance between tracking accuracy and model complexity.
[31.82s -> 37.32s]  What the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity is, does not have a one size fits
[37.32s -> 41.04s]  all single answer in multiple object tracking.
[41.04s -> 46.06s]  Instead, this will depend a lot on the requirements that we have on the multiple object tracking
[46.06s -> 50.62s]  system, which of course is not the same for all scenarios.
[50.62s -> 56.58s]  So we can exemplify what we mean by this by considering so-called bicycle motion models
[56.58s -> 58.46s]  that can be used for cars.
[58.46s -> 63.84s]  And sometimes you should know that this type of motion model is called the single track
[63.84s -> 65.18s]  motion models.
[65.18s -> 69.24s]  So we know that cars have four wheels, they have two rear wheels and two front wheels
[69.24s -> 72.78s]  and the front wheels can be controlled using the steering wheel.
[72.78s -> 77.76s]  So the driver can turn the steering wheel and thereby changing the front wheel angle.
[77.76s -> 82.46s]  And of course, if the car is moving, this will turn the vehicle.
[82.46s -> 86.96s]  The motion modeling of the car can be simplified if we assume instead that the car has two
[86.96s -> 92.34s]  wheels like a bicycle, a single rear wheel and a single front wheel to which the driver
[92.34s -> 94.10s]  can apply some steering.
[94.10s -> 99.44s]  To describe the state of the car in this case, we have the position of the rear wheel.
[99.44s -> 103.48s]  We also have the speed of the car S illustrated by this vector.
[103.48s -> 108.32s]  We have the heading of the car given by the angle of the vector Phi.
[108.32s -> 113.86s]  And lastly, we have the steering angle of the front wheel given by this angle Psi.
[113.86s -> 120.40s]  So this gives us a state vector X with just five states, the 2D position, the speed,
[120.40s -> 122.66s]  the heading and the steering angle.
[122.66s -> 128.52s]  And in this way, we get a quite simple representation, but we also get one that is still accurate
[128.52s -> 131.40s]  enough for multiple object tracking applications.
