[0.00s -> 5.28s]  Hello again. In this presentation, we will define the multiple object tracking problem.
[5.84s -> 10.96s]  And in the following presentations, we will also talk about the most common type of multiple object
[10.96s -> 16.64s]  tracking, which is called tracking based on detections. And lastly, we're going to discuss
[16.64s -> 22.16s]  a few different variants of multiple object tracking. Before we define multiple object
[22.16s -> 27.92s]  tracking, let's have a look at tracking a single object. Single object tracking is
[27.92s -> 34.72s]  an example of a filtering problem. So what we are dealing with is the sequential processing
[34.72s -> 40.32s]  of noisy sensor measurements to determine the object state. By the object state,
[40.32s -> 44.64s]  we mean the object's position together with properties that describe its motion.
[45.20s -> 50.40s]  This could be, for example, its speed and the direction it is heading. Additionally, we can
[50.40s -> 54.96s]  also include parameters that describe other characteristics that are of interest in a
[54.96s -> 61.36s]  particular tracking application. For example, this could be the shape of the object or its size.
[63.44s -> 67.04s]  So we have measurements that are illustrated by these red circles,
[67.68s -> 72.48s]  and we are interested in processing these measurements to estimate the state of the object,
[72.48s -> 79.44s]  which in this case is a car. A complicating aspect of the filtering problem is that the
[79.44s -> 84.96s]  object state is typically neither fully nor directly observed. So what do we mean by this?
[85.68s -> 89.92s]  Well, let's assume that we are interested in the position and the velocity of the car.
[89.92s -> 95.20s]  To estimate this state, let's also assume that we use a radar that gives us measurements of the
[95.20s -> 101.92s]  range and bearing from the radar sensor to the object. But we can't observe the full state,
[101.92s -> 108.88s]  since a single range bearing measurement is related to the position, not to the velocity. In addition,
[108.88s -> 114.24s]  we can't observe the position directly. We have to calculate the position based on the range and
[114.24s -> 120.16s]  the bearing. And lastly, we have to calculate the velocity by processing a sequence of
[120.16s -> 125.84s]  measurements. Multiple object tracking is defined as the sequential processing of noisy sensor
[125.84s -> 133.52s]  measurements to determine the number of dynamic objects and each dynamic object state. Therefore,
[133.52s -> 138.16s]  multiple object tracking is often said to have two equally important parts.
[138.16s -> 143.60s]  The first one is about determining the number of objects. The other is about determining the
[143.60s -> 150.08s]  object states. Indeed, if we were to somehow know exactly the number of objects, the multiple
[150.08s -> 156.32s]  object tracking problem is simplified. So as we have already mentioned, object tracking
[156.32s -> 161.76s]  is a filtering problem. We will review filtering later in this section so that we have it fresh
[161.76s -> 167.68s]  in mind. But please note that you need to know filtering quite well to fully grasp the concepts
[167.68s -> 173.92s]  discussed in this course. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you take the Chalmers X-Course
[173.92s -> 180.00s]  Sensor Fusion and Nonlinear Filtering for Automotive Systems before you take this course.
