[0.00s -> 10.96s]  In this video, we're going to derive a general expression for the posterior density in n-object
[10.96s -> 11.96s]  tracking.
[11.96s -> 17.26s]  In single-object tracking, we saw that the general posterior is a mixture density,
[17.26s -> 21.96s]  where each mixture component corresponds to a sequence of data associations from
[21.96s -> 27.84s]  time 1 to time k, then we have a weight for that sequence of data associations and
[27.84s -> 32.34s]  a posterior density given the sequence of data associations.
[32.34s -> 37.68s]  And remember that the weights are the probabilities of the sequences of data associations.
[37.68s -> 43.28s]  In n-object tracking, we have a general posterior of the same type of format, a mixture
[43.28s -> 48.30s]  density with different data association sequences, where we have a weight for each
[48.30s -> 54.20s]  association sequence and a posterior density conditioned on that association sequence.
[54.20s -> 60.04s]  And again, the weights are the probabilities of the data association sequences.
[60.04s -> 64.68s]  Let's start by considering the posterior when we have a prior that is a mixture.
[64.68s -> 69.78s]  We then get a mixture posterior, where we will see soon that we have a mixture component
[69.78s -> 75.34s]  for each combination of prior hypothesis H and data association θ.
[75.34s -> 81.84s]  If we input the expressions for the measurement and the prior, then we get a double sum over
[81.84s -> 85.98s]  the prior hypothesis H and the data association θ.
[85.98s -> 91.24s]  We have the weight of the prior hypothesis, the joint likelihood for the measurements
[91.24s -> 96.78s]  and the data association, and the prior conditioned on the hypothesis H.
[96.78s -> 103.56s]  And using normalization, we can write this as an unnormalized mixture density.
[103.56s -> 109.44s]  Each mixture component is conditioned on a prior hypothesis H and a data association
[109.44s -> 111.32s]  θ.
[111.32s -> 117.88s]  So if we have a mixture prior, then we get a mixture posterior, and we normalize this
[117.88s -> 121.88s]  by dividing the unnormalized weights by the sum of weights.
[121.88s -> 127.50s]  This gives us a normalized mixture posterior, where each mixture component is conditioned
[127.50s -> 133.60s]  on a prior hypothesis and a data association, and the mixture weight is the probability
[133.60s -> 138.96s]  of the combination of this prior hypothesis and the data association.
[139.00s -> 145.44s]  Typically in n-object tracking, the prior hypotheses correspond to data associations.
[145.44s -> 152.76s]  So it can be shown then that the n-object posterior density at time step k is proportional
[152.76s -> 159.04s]  to a sum over data association sequences from time 1 to time k, where each mixture
[159.04s -> 163.32s]  component is conditioned on this data association sequence.
[163.32s -> 168.48s]  The unnormalized weight of a sequence of data associations is given by the product
[168.52s -> 174.44s]  of the unnormalized weights for each association, each object, and each time step.
[174.44s -> 180.64s]  And conditioned on each data association sequence, the posterior n-object density is
[180.64s -> 186.40s]  an independent density, where for each object we have the posterior conditioned
[186.40s -> 190.16s]  on the data association for that particular object.
[190.16s -> 195.28s]  As we have already seen several times, the posterior weights can be normalized by dividing
[195.28s -> 196.72s]  by the sum of weights.
[196.72s -> 200.84s]  And this gives us the general expression for the posterior density.
[200.84s -> 206.52s]  We have a sum over the different data associations at all time steps, the probability of the
[206.52s -> 213.92s]  data association, and then the posterior conditioned on the data association and the measurements.
[213.92s -> 220.76s]  And due to the rapidly increasing number of mixture components because of the data association,
[220.76s -> 227.64s]  the exact posterior is intractable and approximations are therefore necessary, and different tracking
[227.64s -> 232.88s]  algorithms correspond to different approximations of this posterior density.
