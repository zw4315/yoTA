[0.00s -> 6.00s]  Hello, and welcome to this course, Multi-Object Tracking for Automotive Systems.
[6.00s -> 11.84s]  I'm Leonard Svensson, Professor of Signal Processing at Chalmers University of Technology, working
[11.84s -> 16.88s]  with machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and multi-object tracking.
[16.88s -> 20.80s]  I'm personally very excited about doing this course with you.
[20.80s -> 25.48s]  First, because multi-object tracking is a topic which is quite challenging to learn
[25.48s -> 26.48s]  on your own.
[26.48s -> 32.04s]  Second, because the field has matured significantly over recent years.
[32.04s -> 37.12s]  I hope that you will find our course an easy way to obtain a solid understanding of all
[37.12s -> 40.74s]  the main components in the field.
[40.74s -> 46.52s]  And I'm Carl GeronstrÃ¶m, and I'm a researcher and teacher at Chalmers University of Technology.
[46.52s -> 51.92s]  I've been working on different object tracking problems for about 10 years, with a focus
[51.92s -> 54.40s]  on extended object tracking.
[54.40s -> 58.96s]  During this time, I've been part of many interesting collaborations and projects where
[58.96s -> 64.48s]  tracking has been applied to data from cameras and from lidars and radars.
[64.48s -> 67.04s]  And I think it's a truly fascinating topic.
[67.04s -> 70.68s]  And I look forward to teaching this course.
[70.68s -> 76.72s]  As you know, the automotive and transportation sectors are undergoing a transformation.
[76.72s -> 82.56s]  Autonomous driving is destined to fundamentally change the way we think of cars and transportation.
[82.56s -> 88.48s]  To be safe, autonomous vehicles must be capable of perceiving their surroundings and all objects
[88.48s -> 90.12s]  that move around.
[90.12s -> 94.92s]  In a nutshell, multi-object tracking is about the accurate perception of the driving
[94.92s -> 96.14s]  environment.
[96.14s -> 101.48s]  And this is a key enabling technology for any self-driving vehicle system.
[101.48s -> 106.40s]  The course is divided into six lectures, and we will teach three lectures each.
[106.40s -> 111.32s]  In the first lecture, we will show some motivational examples of multi-object tracking
[111.32s -> 112.68s]  applications.
[112.68s -> 117.96s]  We will define the fundamentals of tracking, and we will discuss what makes tracking a
[117.96s -> 119.76s]  challenging problem.
[119.76s -> 123.92s]  Lecture two is about single object tracking in Clutter.
[123.92s -> 127.76s]  This is where we learn about the basics of object tracking.
[127.76s -> 132.52s]  In particular, we learn about standard models for measurements, when the measurements may
[132.52s -> 137.04s]  contain both object measurements and false measurements.
[137.04s -> 140.76s]  And we study a few simple algorithms for tracking.
[140.84s -> 147.24s]  In the third lecture, we will learn about tracking a known number of multiple objects.
[147.24s -> 152.04s]  And the number of objects is assumed known here to give a gradual increase in the complexity
[152.04s -> 153.72s]  of the problems that we face.
[153.72s -> 158.96s]  So the basic modeling of this problem will be explained, and we will present some different
[158.96s -> 163.00s]  types of algorithms for tracking a known number of objects.
[163.00s -> 167.68s]  In lecture four, we relax the assumption that the number of objects is known, and
[167.68s -> 173.56s]  we introduce random finite sets as an elegant tool to represent uncertainties in both the
[173.56s -> 178.92s]  number of objects that are present and the states of these objects.
[178.92s -> 184.04s]  Random finite sets provide us with a unified framework to model and handle all aspects
[184.04s -> 189.80s]  of multi-object tracking and have become central to the field of multi-object tracking.
[189.80s -> 194.64s]  In the fifth lecture, we will finally arrive where we want to be, and that is tracking
[194.64s -> 198.52s]  an unknown and time varying number of objects.
[198.52s -> 202.72s]  So we will use the random finite set models, and we will present and discuss different
[202.72s -> 205.68s]  algorithms for multiple object tracking.
[205.68s -> 211.12s]  And this includes recent advances like Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filters and delta
[211.12s -> 214.12s]  generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli filters.
[214.12s -> 220.16s]  Finally, in the last lecture, we end by briefly introducing three topics that we
[220.16s -> 226.96s]  believe are important for multi-object tracking in an automotive context, which are deep learning,
[226.96s -> 230.76s]  sets of trajectories, and extended object tracking.
[230.76s -> 235.80s]  As an example, there are a few videos about deep learning, but rather than teaching
[235.80s -> 240.44s]  you how to do deep learning, which is beyond the scope of this course, we highlight the
[240.44s -> 245.32s]  importance of deep learning in multi-object tracking and discuss the role it may play
[245.32s -> 246.32s]  in the future.
[246.48s -> 251.92s]  So please note that this course is a sequel to sensor fusion and non-linear filtering
[251.92s -> 253.92s]  for automotive systems.
[253.92s -> 259.24s]  So therefore, unless you already have a solid background in sensor fusion and non-linear
[259.24s -> 263.72s]  filtering, we strongly recommend that you first complete that course.
[263.72s -> 267.44s]  Of course, it's available via edX.
[267.44s -> 273.24s]  When questions or thoughts pop up about the content, exercises, or assignments, don't
[273.24s -> 276.08s]  hesitate to make a post in the discussion forum.
[276.08s -> 281.32s]  We have seen many times that active participation in discussions about the material improves
[281.32s -> 282.32s]  the learning.
[282.32s -> 285.80s]  Again, most welcome to this course.
[285.80s -> 289.32s]  We look forward to getting to know you, and good luck with your studies!
