[0.00s -> 10.50s]  Like we did in single object tracking, we're going to denote the measurements by capital
[10.50s -> 17.52s]  Z with a subindex k for the time, and the number of measurements will be noted by m
[17.52s -> 19.28s]  with a subindex k.
[19.28s -> 23.54s]  The measurements consist of both clutter and object detections, and the clutter we
[23.54s -> 29.90s]  denote like before by capital C and the object detections by capital O.
[29.90s -> 36.74s]  And similarly to single object tracking, the measurements are a random permutation of the
[36.74s -> 40.54s]  columns in the two matrices O and C.
[40.54s -> 45.84s]  Like before, the clutter is Poisson, it has some intensity lambda C, which we can
[45.84s -> 52.94s]  also describe as the product of a Poisson rate lambda bar and a spatial density f.
[52.94s -> 59.26s]  The object detections consist of object detections from the n objects, so O1 all
[59.26s -> 61.44s]  the way to O n.
[61.44s -> 66.20s]  For each object i, the measurements O i are modeled by the same measurement model that
[66.20s -> 68.56s]  we used in single object tracking.
[68.56s -> 74.68s]  With probability 1 minus P d, we get no measurement, so a missed detection, and with probability
[74.68s -> 80.34s]  P d, we get a single detection that is modeled by a likelihood g k.
[80.34s -> 84.20s]  So what we need, and what we're going to do in this section, is to see what the
[84.20s -> 88.46s]  n object measurement likelihood P of z given x is.
[88.46s -> 93.34s]  And this likelihood includes the clutter, it includes the detections, and it also includes
[93.34s -> 96.64s]  the missed detections from all of the objects.
[96.64s -> 100.72s]  In single object tracking, we saw that we could describe the measurement likelihood
[100.72s -> 105.04s]  P of z given x as a sum over data associations.
[105.04s -> 108.84s]  And the same thing is true also for tracking n objects.
[108.84s -> 114.38s]  We have a sum over the joint density of the measurements z and the data association
[114.38s -> 117.68s]  theta given the object states x.
[117.80s -> 121.78s]  And we can further describe this as a product of two densities.
[121.78s -> 127.14s]  The measurements given the object states, the association theta, and the number of
[127.14s -> 133.02s]  measurements multiplied by the density over the data association theta and the number
[133.02s -> 136.26s]  of measurements m given the object states.
[136.26s -> 141.74s]  To derive this measurement likelihood for n objects, we need to define the data association
[141.74s -> 144.70s]  variable theta for n objects.
[144.70s -> 150.86s]  And we also need to have a look at what the set of valid associations capital theta is.
[150.86s -> 155.60s]  For the joint likelihood of the measurements and the data association given the object
[155.60s -> 161.50s]  states, we need the association condition measurement model, and we also need the association
[161.50s -> 162.82s]  prior.
[162.82s -> 165.28s]  So that's what we're going to learn about in this section.
