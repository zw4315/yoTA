[0.00s -> 8.68s]  So here's our first quiz. You generate a perfectly random key k. You send two messages,
[8.68s -> 16.80s]  m1 and m2, encrypted with the one-time pad algorithm. So c1 is equal to k XOR m1, and
[16.80s -> 25.08s]  c2 is equal to k XOR m2. Does sending c2 leak information about m1 and m2?
