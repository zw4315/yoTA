[0.00s -> 3.00s]  In this unit, you will learn a lot about packet switching.
[3.00s -> 8.00s]  It's quite an intense unit, and your head might be spinning with packets by the end of it.
[8.00s -> 10.00s]  But that's why we have videos.
[10.00s -> 14.00s]  You can cover the material at your own pace and review it several times.
[14.00s -> 20.00s]  We'll start out with a leisurely look at why the Internet and almost all modern networks
[20.00s -> 23.00s]  are built on the foundation of packet switching.
[23.00s -> 28.00s]  Packet switching is simple in the sense that each packet is a self-contained unit
[28.00s -> 32.00s]  of data that carries information necessary for it to reach its destination.
[32.00s -> 38.00s]  Packet switching is efficient in the sense that it keeps a link busy whenever there is work to be done,
[38.00s -> 42.00s]  rather than have dedicated capacity reserved for each user or each application.
[42.00s -> 48.00s]  So after a leisurely introduction to packet switching, we'll dive deeply into some of the consequences.
[48.00s -> 53.00s]  We'll take a journey that includes more math than you'll see in any other unit in this course.
[53.00s -> 57.00s]  The math might seem a little daunting at first, but it's actually quite simple.
[57.00s -> 63.00s]  Once you learn the math, so many other details and complex questions become really easy to answer and understand.
[63.00s -> 70.00s]  For example, you'll learn why two packets traveling between the same two end hosts might encounter a different delay.
[70.00s -> 75.00s]  While the time they spend traversing each link is the same, the packets might take different paths
[75.00s -> 78.00s]  and experience different queuing delays in the router buffers.
[78.00s -> 83.00s]  Make sure you fully understand the three main components of packet delay.
[83.00s -> 89.00s]  The packetization delay, the propagation delay, and the queuing delay.
[89.00s -> 92.00s]  And that you understand the physical processes that cause them.
[92.00s -> 95.00s]  By the end of this unit, you'll be able to answer questions like,
[95.00s -> 99.00s]  How long does it take a packet to get from here to London?
[99.00s -> 103.00s]  Or, How many packets can I fit in space between the Moon and Mars?
[103.00s -> 105.00s]  You'll understand why routers have buffers,
[105.00s -> 109.00s]  and how queuing delay leads to uncertainty about when packets will arrive.
[110.00s -> 112.00s]  For most applications, this isn't an issue.
[112.00s -> 116.00s]  But for real-time streaming applications, like Skype and YouTube,
[116.00s -> 120.00s]  they need to play back smooth, pick up free audio and video to the user,
[120.00s -> 124.00s]  and still need to absorb the variation delay across the internet.
[124.00s -> 128.00s]  You'll learn how playback buffers are designed for this exact purpose.
[128.00s -> 132.00s]  Finally, you'll learn about how packet switches work in practice.
[132.00s -> 135.00s]  At the end of the unit, you'll also be able to answer the question,
[135.00s -> 137.00s]  How does an internet router actually work?
[137.00s -> 139.00s]  And how is it different from an ethernet switch?
[139.00s -> 143.00s]  How does a router arrange its lookup tables internally?
[143.00s -> 146.00s]  It's quite a whistle-stop tour of packet switching,
[146.00s -> 148.00s]  and by the end of the unit, you should have a good intuition
[148.00s -> 151.00s]  of how packet switching actually works in the internet.
