[0.00s -> 6.00s]  Welcome to Unit 5. In Unit 5, we're going to talk about applications.
[6.00s -> 10.00s]  In some ways, all of the internet, what it's about is being able to drive these applications.
[10.00s -> 15.00s]  It's kind of what makes the whole thing useful and interesting and such a dynamic engine of change.
[15.00s -> 22.00s]  In this unit, we're going to talk about three applications in particular that are really cornerstones of the modern internet.
[22.00s -> 28.00s]  The first is DNS, the Domain Name System, which we've seen mentioned a couple of times before, but we're going to go into it in depth.
[28.00s -> 37.00s]  DNS uses UDP as its transport protocol. It's a simple client-server exchange where you can ask for names and get information about those names.
[37.00s -> 41.00s]  The second application we're going to go into is HTTP or the World Wide Web.
[41.00s -> 47.00s]  HTTP operates over TCP, so a different transport protocol, but again, it's a client-server exchange.
[47.00s -> 57.00s]  We're going to see how HTTP requests look like and some changes that have happened in the past couple of years or so with more recent versions of HTTP that are emerging based on Google's speed.
[57.00s -> 65.00s]  Finally, we're going to look at BitTorrent. BitTorrent is an interesting application because of what fraction of internet traffic today is over BitTorrent.
[65.00s -> 71.00s]  It's an application that uses TCP as its reliable transport. On the other hand, it's not a client-server model.
[71.00s -> 79.00s]  It uses this peer-to-peer model of swarms that exchange pieces of large files and somehow altogether manage to transfer data at a tremendous rate.
[79.00s -> 83.00s]  But we're going to start with NATs, Network Address Translation Devices.
[83.00s -> 95.00s]  You've seen them before in UNEP1, and in what we're going to be describing in the first few videos, we're going to look at not only how they've allowed growth of the edges of the internet,
[95.00s -> 103.00s]  but how they allow multiple endpoints to hide, to essentially look behind a single IP address.
[103.00s -> 114.00s]  It started as really solving two problems. One was making it easy for a network to appear behind one IP address so that if you're allocated one IP address by a provider,
[114.00s -> 122.00s]  you can then provide a number of private IP addresses that sit behind. And probably your own home Wi-Fi router works this way.
[122.00s -> 132.00s]  The second thing is that because they're translating addresses primarily in the direction that goes from the edge towards the core, they don't naturally accept incoming connections.
[132.00s -> 140.00s]  So they provide a sort of rudimentary security feature, which is that it makes it hard for a connection to be opened up to an edge device and therefore to attack it.
[140.00s -> 146.00s]  However, the consequence of this is that it has significant implications for applications.
[146.00s -> 153.00s]  Basically it makes it a lot harder for any kind of application that wants to initiate communication with an edge device.
[153.00s -> 159.00s]  So there have been all sorts of things that we're going to learn about in this unit about not only how a NAT's built,
[159.00s -> 163.00s]  but what some of the implications are and some of the things that people have done to try and get around those.
[163.00s -> 170.00s]  If you build an internet application today, you have to work around NAT's. You have to know how they work, and they're going to be a big headache.
[170.00s -> 175.00s]  So I think it's really important you learn how they work down in detail, all the different kinds of NAT's and why they're complicated to handle.
[175.00s -> 183.00s]  So hopefully by the end of this unit, you'll be able to really build your new fantastic application that will take the internet on its next steps.
