[0.00s -> 3.64s]  In this unit, you learned some of the basics of how the Internet works.
[3.64s -> 7.28s]  You learned how applications like web browsing and Skype work, how an application uses the
[7.28s -> 10.80s]  Internet, and the basic structure of the Internet itself.
[10.80s -> 13.96s]  You learned some of the fundamental architectural principles of networking.
[13.96s -> 18.72s]  Perhaps by now you know which one of us is Phil, and which one of us is Nick.
[18.72s -> 21.88s]  Now that you've finished the first unit, you should be familiar with this picture
[21.88s -> 24.10s]  of the four-layer model of the Internet.
[24.10s -> 27.36s]  You now know that the Internet is broken down into these four distinct layers, what
[27.36s -> 29.60s]  they are, and how they work together.
[29.60s -> 34.12s]  But even more importantly than how they work, you hopefully understand why the Internet works
[34.12s -> 39.78s]  this way, and why layering is a good idea in all networks, not just the Internet.
[39.78s -> 44.00s]  You've seen that the Internet works by breaking up data into small units called packets.
[44.00s -> 47.88s]  When you request a web page, your computer sends some packets to a web server.
[47.88s -> 51.72s]  The Internet decides how those little pieces of data arrive to the right destination,
[51.72s -> 55.52s]  and how the packets the web server responds with, containing the page, make their way
[55.52s -> 57.80s]  to you correctly as well.
[57.80s -> 62.48s]  You've learned how two architectural principles, layering and packets, come together in the
[62.48s -> 65.76s]  architectural principle of encapsulation.
[65.76s -> 68.68s]  Encapsulation is how one takes layers, and lets them use packets in a clean and
[68.68s -> 72.68s]  simple way, such that each layer's use of a packet is independent of the others.
[72.68s -> 77.76s]  We'll talk about a few more architectural principles in future units.
[77.76s -> 82.84s]  So to be specific, what we've learned so far in this unit, we've studied four
[82.84s -> 84.24s]  main topics.
[84.24s -> 87.76s]  First, how an application uses the Internet.
[87.76s -> 91.52s]  Phil explained the common way in which a variety of different applications, such as
[91.52s -> 96.52s]  Skype, BitTorrent, and the web, all use the Internet in a very similar manner.
[96.52s -> 100.32s]  You learned that most applications want to communicate over a reliable bi-directional
[100.32s -> 104.12s]  byte stream between two or more endpoints.
[104.12s -> 108.20s]  The second thing that you learned about was the structure of the Internet, and specifically
[108.20s -> 109.96s]  the four-layer model.
[109.96s -> 113.48s]  You learned what the four-layer model is, the responsibility of each layer.
[113.48s -> 117.96s]  You also learned why we use the Internet Protocol, or IP, every time we send packets
[117.96s -> 123.00s]  across the Internet, and why we call IP the thin waste of the Internet.
[123.00s -> 127.56s]  The third thing we learned about was specifically the Internet Protocol, what it is.
[127.56s -> 131.72s]  And because IP is so important, we spent several videos describing what IP does for
[131.72s -> 133.92s]  us and how it works.
[133.92s -> 138.60s]  So far we've discussed just IP version 4, because it's the most widely used version
[138.60s -> 139.60s]  of IP today.
[139.60s -> 144.92s]  You've learned about IP addresses, how routers look up IP addresses, and so on.
[144.92s -> 151.32s]  Later on, we'll be learning about a newer version of IP called IP version 6.
[151.32s -> 155.00s]  The fourth topic was basic architectural ideas and principles.
[155.00s -> 159.52s]  You've studied three fundamental principles of networks, all of which are very relevant
[159.52s -> 161.44s]  to our understanding of the Internet.
[161.44s -> 165.32s]  The first is packet switching, which is the simple way in which data is broken down
[165.32s -> 169.28s]  into self-contained packets of information that are forwarded hop by hop based on the
[169.28s -> 171.92s]  information in the packet header.
[171.92s -> 175.60s]  The second is layering, which was mentioned and seen in detail.
[175.60s -> 180.44s]  The third is encapsulation, which is the process of placing a packet processed at one
[180.44s -> 184.72s]  layer inside the data portion of a packet in the layer below.
[184.72s -> 189.60s]  This helps provide a clear separation of concerns between how data is processed at each layer
[189.60s -> 192.24s]  in the hierarchy.
[192.24s -> 196.20s]  You should now have a good understanding of the basic structure of the Internet, and three
[196.20s -> 198.16s]  basic architectural ideas.
[198.16s -> 201.68s]  You understand how applications like your web browser works, and how the Internet delivers
[201.68s -> 204.52s]  packets between two computers.
[204.52s -> 208.88s]  You now know what TCP is, and what IP is, and why they're related.
[208.88s -> 213.40s]  At first glance, these might seem like grungy low-level details, but it turns out that
[213.40s -> 216.70s]  these are the bedrock of what the Internet is.
[216.70s -> 220.92s]  Every year, new applications and uses of the Internet emerge, but all of them use these
[220.92s -> 225.16s]  basic principles you're learning about, and almost all of them use TCP IP.
[225.16s -> 229.16s]  By starting with these fundamentals that have remained amazingly constant, you'll learn
[229.16s -> 233.00s]  the knowledge that will continue to be important even as we move on to 5G wireless
[233.00s -> 236.16s]  networks, Web 3.0, and the Internet of Things.
[236.16s -> 237.88s]  And that's part of what's exciting.
[237.88s -> 242.32s]  The Internet and what it can do is always expanding and changing, but there are some
[242.32s -> 246.08s]  core ideas and principles which are constant through all of that evolution.
[246.08s -> 250.76s]  By learning them, you not only learn how the Internet works and how networks today
[250.76s -> 254.88s]  work, but most likely how they'll work even in 20 years or more.
