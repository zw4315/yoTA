[0.00s -> 5.56s]  It will take at most 2 to the 368 attempts.
[5.56s -> 9.46s]  The two random values are known by an adversary because they're sent in clear text.
[9.46s -> 14.82s]  The one true secret is the premaster secret, which is 46 bits long.
[14.82s -> 18.72s]  If the adversary can guess this value, then it can recompute the master secret
[18.72s -> 20.56s]  using the pseudo-random function.
[20.56s -> 23.28s]  With a master secret, it can recompute the keys.
[23.28s -> 25.84s]  2 to the 368 is enormous.
