[0.00s -> 10.62s]  So, I'm here today with Reid Hunt, who is best known for being the chairman of the
[10.62s -> 14.48s]  FCC during the Clinton administration in the mid-1990s.
[14.48s -> 18.56s]  It was a very exciting time for development of communications.
[18.56s -> 23.38s]  There was the Telecommunications Act, there was huge growth of the internet leading
[23.38s -> 28.44s]  up to the internet bubble at the end of the 1990s, there was the beginnings of
[28.44s -> 29.44s]  auctions of Spectrum.
[29.88s -> 34.08s]  Really was a time of very rapid change, so it's a real pleasure and delight to
[34.08s -> 37.08s]  have Reid Hunt here with us today.
[37.08s -> 41.76s]  Hi Reid, how are you doing? Good, good to be with you Nick and good to be with your
[41.76s -> 48.96s]  39,000 students. So Reid has been very involved in the last few months of
[48.96s -> 55.36s]  raising the debate and asking many questions about the very controversial
[55.36s -> 60.92s]  topic of data privacy, government tapping, government eavesdropping on citizens, and
[60.92s -> 65.40s]  all of the things related to the Snowden leaks and the NSA. So it's very
[65.40s -> 70.48s]  relevant and very timely to be able to have Reid talk with us today.
[70.48s -> 74.40s]  So Reid, I just wanted to ask you a very first, to start with, really a more
[74.40s -> 79.28s]  general question. Many of the students that are watching from outside the
[79.28s -> 83.12s]  United States and perhaps don't know what the FCC is, the Federal
[83.16s -> 87.48s]  Communications Commission and what they do, what their responsibilities are. Can you just give us an
[87.48s -> 92.36s]  overview of what the FCC is responsible for? You bet. The Federal Communications
[92.36s -> 98.00s]  Commission is what in the United States we call an independent regulatory
[98.00s -> 103.72s]  agency. There are five commissioners, one of them is the chair. I was the chair
[103.72s -> 110.16s]  because Bill Clinton picked me among the commissioners to be a chair in 1993.
[110.76s -> 117.28s]  It is independent of the executive branch, meaning the president cannot tell
[117.28s -> 124.60s]  the FCC what to do. It gets its powers from the legislature, but once it
[124.60s -> 130.40s]  has those powers, it regulates and the only check and balance on the
[130.40s -> 136.36s]  regulation comes from the courts because companies, individuals, can
[136.36s -> 140.08s]  challenge the regulations and say that they're illegal or they're
[140.08s -> 145.44s]  unconstitutional and can take the issue to the court. So the Federal
[145.44s -> 150.92s]  Communications Commission as an independent regulatory agency is quite
[150.92s -> 155.36s]  a bit different than the regulatory agencies in many, many other countries
[155.36s -> 160.72s]  for two reasons. Number one, in many other countries the
[160.72s -> 167.00s]  regulatory agencies do report to the executive branch and second, in many
[167.00s -> 173.44s]  other countries, many parts of the communications industry are owned by the
[173.44s -> 178.52s]  government in whole or in part, as is the case in China, as is the case in
[178.52s -> 186.32s]  Germany, as is in the case of France and other countries. So in the U.S. we
[186.32s -> 190.56s]  don't have government ownership of the information communications and
[190.56s -> 196.20s]  technology sector with a few very, very minor exceptions. There are some small
[196.20s -> 201.40s]  towns that own their own telephone companies and we have a regulatory
[201.40s -> 206.04s]  agency that is independent of the rest of government. By far the Federal
[206.04s -> 212.24s]  Communications Commission is the most powerful regulatory agency for the
[212.24s -> 217.64s]  information communications and technology sector in the United States and
[217.64s -> 222.80s]  relative to all other regulators in the world in this sector, it is by far the
[222.80s -> 229.08s]  most powerful agency. So during the 1990s, during those times of
[229.08s -> 234.68s]  just enormous change, you know, in every aspect of communication, long distance
[234.68s -> 241.12s]  telephone communications, deregulation of the industry and the growth of
[241.12s -> 245.24s]  the internet, the auctioning of spectrum, the changing of rules on
[245.24s -> 248.36s]  consolidation of radio stations, of ownership of radio stations, they were just
[248.36s -> 254.20s]  massive changes. So what role did the FCC play in that and to what extent
[254.20s -> 258.12s]  were those changes foreseen and understood? Because they must have
[258.12s -> 261.88s]  meant big changes to the FCC itself, not only to the policy that it was
[261.88s -> 273.20s]  advocating. So I became the FCC chairman 20 years ago next month, November 1993,
[273.20s -> 278.80s]  and approximately that was the month that the internet was invented as a
[278.80s -> 285.48s]  commercial matter, meaning that was approximately when Mark Andreessen's
[285.48s -> 293.92s]  mosaic browser was exploding across the United States and then the rest of the
[293.92s -> 298.52s]  world and when everyone saw that the internet could be used not just for
[298.52s -> 305.96s]  text and not just for fairly academic discourse but rather you could get to
[305.96s -> 311.04s]  the internet by plugging in your own personal computer to the telephone
[311.04s -> 316.84s]  network and you could download the browser and then with this browser you
[316.84s -> 322.80s]  could turn your own PC into a website and also go to anybody else's website
[322.80s -> 328.64s]  and see pictures or listen to music and all of a sudden really in just the
[328.64s -> 332.64s]  matter of weeks everybody in the United States and pretty soon everybody
[332.64s -> 339.52s]  in the world said holy cow, this is going to completely transform the world.
[339.52s -> 346.08s]  So two things were told to me right away by a whole bunch of people in
[346.08s -> 352.52s]  technology. The first was something said to me by Nicholas Negroponte who then
[352.52s -> 358.64s]  was running MIT Media Labs. He said you need to understand that everything
[358.64s -> 365.10s]  in communications is backwards and I said what do you mean and he said well we
[365.10s -> 370.28s]  use the airwaves for broadcast television, we use the airwaves for video.
[370.28s -> 375.36s]  Video is lots of data and the airwaves as a matter of physics are
[375.36s -> 385.14s]  really not well suited to carry all that data and we use lines, copper, we use
[385.14s -> 390.28s]  an underground physical network to carry voice communication but that's
[390.28s -> 394.40s]  really where the data ought to be where you have lots of packets to carry
[394.40s -> 400.38s]  because voice is hardly any data. So he said your job at the FCC is to do
[400.42s -> 406.06s]  what I call the Negroponte switch. You need to have all voice communication go
[406.06s -> 410.66s]  over the air and all data communication go in physical networks that are
[410.66s -> 417.06s]  terrestrial. So that is a big strategic change and what he meant in the
[417.06s -> 421.98s]  American system is not that the FCC would order that but that it would
[421.98s -> 426.66s]  change all the regulations so that companies that wanted to execute on this
[426.66s -> 432.52s]  great switch actually could do so. So they could get spectrum for mobile
[432.52s -> 436.02s]  communications so that they could build physical networks that
[436.02s -> 441.30s]  interconnected with existing networks so that they could write their content
[441.30s -> 444.66s]  differently so that they could have access to networks for different kinds
[444.66s -> 449.62s]  of content and in a very very big picture way that's exactly what we
[449.62s -> 456.26s]  tried to do starting in 1993 and I gotta tell you the FCC was hugely
[456.26s -> 460.98s]  successful in the American tech industry was hugely successful and the
[460.98s -> 466.94s]  American communications industry was also very successful in executing the
[466.94s -> 474.88s]  biggest transformation at scale of any businesses in history meaning the
[474.88s -> 481.46s]  entire Bell network went from a fixed line voice telephony network to an
[481.46s -> 487.82s]  over-the-air mobile communications network and that represented well more
[487.82s -> 491.54s]  than a hundred billion dollars of capital expenditure in a complete
[491.54s -> 497.94s]  transformation of every aspect of the way that they were doing business. So
[497.94s -> 502.22s]  that was the big switch and then I told you there were two
[502.22s -> 505.58s]  things I was told. Here was the other thing I was told and I was told this
[505.58s -> 512.42s]  by Andy Grove, the CEO of Intel at the Stanford Park Hotel about 400
[512.42s -> 517.86s]  meters from where you're sitting right now, Nick, in the beginning of 1994. He
[517.86s -> 523.82s]  said you need to understand that this is a war and I said what do you mean
[523.82s -> 531.22s]  it's a war and he said data packet switch data is the disruptive enemy of
[531.22s -> 536.42s]  circuit switched communication. I'm going to let you make sure that you've taught
[536.42s -> 544.42s]  all your students exactly what that means. He said you need to understand that those who
[544.42s -> 549.94s]  depend on analog communication and circuit switch technology are going to
[549.94s -> 553.78s]  be relegated to the dustbin of history and you need to make sure the
[553.78s -> 557.66s]  government doesn't try to save them, that the government makes the way for
[557.66s -> 564.22s]  the winning technology. So we really tried to do that and that really, really
[564.22s -> 570.10s]  did happen and there were many losers as a consequence. I'll conclude by
[570.10s -> 576.70s]  giving you the biggest example of a huge loser. By the late 1990s, AT&T
[576.70s -> 582.34s]  was the dominant long-distance company in the United States and the
[582.34s -> 587.42s]  most powerful international company in the communications area waving the
[587.42s -> 591.82s]  American flag as its headquarters. More than a hundred billion dollars of
[591.82s -> 598.14s]  market cap, immensely significant in every major city in the world. Within
[598.14s -> 603.02s]  less than 10 years its market cap was one-tenth of that and it was sold for
[603.02s -> 611.90s]  a song to SBC which took its name as AT&T. It did not execute on either the
[611.90s -> 618.86s]  switch from circuit to packet or the move from landline to voice being
[618.86s -> 627.14s]  mobile or the move to physical networks carrying data as their dominant
[627.14s -> 631.62s]  mode of business. It didn't execute on any of those changes and it was a huge
[631.62s -> 635.50s]  loser. So if you look at some of the big changes that happened during that
[635.50s -> 641.58s]  time, are there some that if you got to go back and revisit them that
[642.14s -> 649.34s]  you think should have been handled a little differently? In the United
[649.34s -> 660.34s]  States, no. The information communications revolution meant a commitment as a
[660.34s -> 664.82s]  matter of business and as a matter of government to the notion that there
[664.82s -> 670.86s]  would be winning companies and losing companies. That was a reversal of the
[670.86s -> 675.30s]  traditional policy which was this, nobody would win a lot and nobody would
[675.30s -> 681.98s]  ever lose. In other words, stability. In other words, one big
[681.98s -> 688.70s]  company, a few companies in broadcast, lots of little radio companies, one major
[688.70s -> 695.14s]  newspaper in every city, tremendous stability, very little innovation, no risk,
[695.14s -> 699.42s]  the communications platform would be like the ground under your feet. It
[699.42s -> 704.66s]  wouldn't ever be subject to the earthquake. It wouldn't ever be at risk
[704.66s -> 710.06s]  and instead we moved to a completely different model. Tremendous upheaval,
[710.06s -> 716.18s]  tremendous challenge for the companies to change, a willingness to cope
[716.18s -> 721.98s]  with change and the result was that we had a fantastic economic boom. So
[721.98s -> 728.98s]  there's really nothing about that at the big picture level that I think we
[729.34s -> 733.82s]  should regret. So one of the consequences of the big change to the
[733.82s -> 738.30s]  internet is that that stability that we saw that was holding back some of the
[738.30s -> 742.22s]  circuit switch world now has become a stability holding back the packet
[742.22s -> 746.90s]  switch world and for example the industry structure around an internet
[746.90s -> 751.66s]  architecture, a narrow waste of IP that really has not changed very much
[751.66s -> 755.74s]  over the last 15 or 20 years and an industry structure that has favored
[756.34s -> 761.98s]  closed vertically integrated equipment for which the pace of innovation of the
[761.98s -> 765.90s]  networking equipment itself has been relatively slow, particularly if we compare it to the
[765.90s -> 771.30s]  computer industry as a whole. Now there are changes afoot to sort of break
[771.30s -> 777.54s]  apart some of that vertical integration and open up
[777.54s -> 782.34s]  interfaces and bring about a more sort of a software-based rate of innovation
[782.34s -> 787.58s]  in the network infrastructure. Do you think that government and government
[787.58s -> 792.98s]  regulation has a place to, in a sense, the governance and driving of the
[792.98s -> 802.10s]  internet? Well I would say yes and no. So I think you're describing, one way
[802.10s -> 807.38s]  to talk about what you're describing is the difference between a closed and
[807.38s -> 811.82s]  open and another way to talk about it is the difference between horizontal and
[811.82s -> 820.78s]  vertical. So what do we mean by horizontal? Well the famous writings of
[820.78s -> 825.98s]  Andy Grove in the 1990s about the computer industry all focused on the
[825.98s -> 831.30s]  notion that the industry was horizontally organized. There would be a
[831.30s -> 836.54s]  chip industry, Intel would be his primary example and it was indeed
[836.54s -> 841.54s]  without question the most profitable semiconductor business that ever existed
[841.54s -> 845.58s]  still is the most profitable semiconductor business that has ever
[845.58s -> 851.74s]  existed but it did not move vertical. It did not do the software that is the
[851.74s -> 857.34s]  operating system and it didn't do above that the application layer and
[857.34s -> 861.94s]  similarly if you want to extrapolate to different services that might be
[861.94s -> 868.26s]  provided as versions of delivering on applications, Intel wasn't involved in
[868.26s -> 872.18s]  that. There would be different companies at each of these layers. There would be
[872.18s -> 878.70s]  competition within the layers but the layers themselves would cooperate in
[878.70s -> 883.58s]  order to deliver the finished product. That's the horizontal non-vertical
[883.58s -> 889.14s]  model. The great challenge to that is the Apple model, right?
[889.14s -> 894.86s]  Which is, we'll just do everything from the bottom to the top and it won't be
[894.86s -> 899.58s]  open to anybody and we may get vendors to provide things but everything will be
[899.58s -> 906.02s]  done will be done our way. If you ask, should government dictate a horizontal
[906.02s -> 911.06s]  market structure or vertical market structure, I would say government should
[911.06s -> 918.86s]  really enjoy the battle of the different companies for economic success
[918.86s -> 922.82s]  with different models. There's no obvious reason why government should say
[922.82s -> 927.98s]  one model is better than another model. That's horizontal and vertical. Now let's
[927.98s -> 933.14s]  talk about open and closed. Open and closed has at least two different
[933.14s -> 939.94s]  meanings. One is the meaning that I think you might apply to standards. So
[939.94s -> 948.02s]  for example, let's take the Microsoft operating system. Was that an open system?
[948.02s -> 952.98s]  Well, not really. You had to get permission to design an application for
[952.98s -> 958.06s]  it and even if you got that permission, it would be not open in any way
[958.06s -> 963.70s]  like the Android system. First of all, it wasn't open because people would have to pay for
[963.70s -> 969.70s]  access to it and second, it wasn't open because it didn't permit a
[969.70s -> 975.74s]  community of innovators to alter it and use it in a particular manner. So
[975.94s -> 981.10s]  should government speak to that kind of open and closed? Again, I think that's a
[981.10s -> 985.10s]  question of business model and the government ought to keep its nose out of
[985.10s -> 992.38s]  that. But another meaning of open and closed is where those words apply to
[992.38s -> 998.54s]  what an antitrust lawyer like me would call bottleneck or monopoly power. So
[999.26s -> 1007.86s]  take a look for example at Google's market share in search. Any government
[1007.86s -> 1012.14s]  in the world would say that the 80-90% market share that Google has
[1012.14s -> 1017.90s]  for search represents a monopoly market share. And that search engine is
[1017.90s -> 1023.98s]  not open, meaning there's nothing more closed or carefully guarded or kept
[1023.98s -> 1029.22s]  secret than Google's algorithms for search and nobody else on the outside
[1029.22s -> 1034.10s]  can get access to them and alter them in some particular way so as to, for
[1034.10s -> 1041.90s]  example, optimize for searching the works of you, Nick, or my works, you
[1041.90s -> 1047.74s]  know, on the internet. Now, should government get involved in opening
[1047.74s -> 1052.90s]  bottlenecks? And the answer is sometimes. When those bottlenecks represent
[1052.90s -> 1059.34s]  monopoly power that is going to be used to thwart innovation or crush competition,
[1059.34s -> 1065.06s]  that's when government should get involved. I see. So I'd like to move the
[1065.06s -> 1069.66s]  conversation a little bit towards more recent events and privacy and
[1069.66s -> 1077.66s]  matters of security. So, you know, as far back as 1994, US Congress passed the
[1077.66s -> 1082.30s]  Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which was
[1082.30s -> 1085.86s]  quite controversial at the time, but it was originally put there to aid law
[1085.86s -> 1089.22s]  enforcement in its efforts to conduct surveillance of digital telephone
[1089.22s -> 1094.66s]  networks. What was that about and how did that affect and lay the
[1094.66s -> 1097.02s]  groundwork for where we are today?
[1097.02s -> 1102.58s]  Okay, so, you know, just to go back in history, in that time period,
[1102.58s -> 1107.74s]  approximately 20 years ago, voice communication was over these landline
[1107.74s -> 1111.94s]  networks for the most part, not over cellular and certainly not over anything
[1112.34s -> 1116.86s]  like the internet. It was over these circuit switch networks. And since almost
[1116.86s -> 1123.14s]  all voice communication was on those networks, that meant that the actual
[1123.14s -> 1129.26s]  communications themselves would be consolidated within the networks of
[1129.26s -> 1133.42s]  just a few companies. And they were all regulated by the FCC. They're still
[1133.42s -> 1140.18s]  regulated by the FCC. So in that time period, 20 years ago, it was physically
[1140.18s -> 1146.26s]  possible to have the government, either through the FCC or through some other
[1146.26s -> 1150.42s]  arm of government, go to just a handful of companies and say, you're
[1150.42s -> 1154.34s]  going to see all the phone calls in America and most phone calls in the
[1154.34s -> 1159.58s]  world are physically going to go through the United States. Even if
[1159.58s -> 1162.74s]  they're going from China to Europe, they're probably going to go through the
[1162.74s -> 1167.14s]  United States. So you're going to see almost all phone calls in the world and
[1167.18s -> 1173.58s]  under certain conditions, we want to eavesdrop on those phone calls. So it was
[1173.58s -> 1179.98s]  physically easy and from a regulatory perspective, it wasn't very intrusive. The
[1179.98s -> 1184.06s]  only question in that time period, there were two questions. Question one
[1184.06s -> 1188.78s]  would be, would the government have to get a warrant from a court to get access
[1188.78s -> 1194.26s]  to those calls? And question two would be, well, who would pay for the eavesdropping?
[1194.26s -> 1198.58s]  Because it was actually a fairly complex technical matter to do that.
[1198.58s -> 1205.02s]  The FBI wanted the FCC to order the phone companies to pay and I told the
[1205.02s -> 1209.38s]  FBI, I'm not doing that. You can figure out how to get the phone
[1209.38s -> 1213.10s]  companies to pay. I have no idea how you'll do that. But if you can't do
[1213.10s -> 1216.82s]  that, go to Congress and get an appropriation and you spend the money.
[1216.82s -> 1222.26s]  So it may seem a little antiquated but the primary debate was about who
[1222.26s -> 1224.30s]  would get the money to do it.
[1224.30s -> 1229.74s]  I see. So moving the clock forward to today, when an internet
[1229.74s -> 1233.94s]  service provider or even an equipment vendor such as, you know, Cisco, Juniper,
[1233.94s -> 1241.02s]  Alcatel-Lucent or Huawei is building equipment for use by an operator,
[1241.02s -> 1245.74s]  whose responsibility is it to create the technical ability and who
[1245.74s -> 1250.50s]  pays for the ability to tap internet communications?
[1251.02s -> 1254.54s]  Okay, well, first of all, as far as the who pays part is concerned,
[1254.54s -> 1259.54s]  the debate hasn't changed one bit from where it was 20 years ago, right?
[1259.54s -> 1263.30s]  So the idea of the different agencies and government is, well,
[1263.30s -> 1266.46s]  we don't have any money so you companies ought to do all the work
[1266.46s -> 1271.54s]  of assembling the data and when you've got it all organized and when you've
[1271.54s -> 1275.30s]  figured out the database and when you've used Hadoop to get all the
[1275.30s -> 1280.10s]  unstructured data in some kind of searchable form, we'll just show up
[1280.10s -> 1284.38s]  and we'll just borrow it, we'll just have access to it, right?
[1284.38s -> 1288.58s]  So that's actually what all the newspaper accounts have said that
[1288.58s -> 1291.30s]  the American agencies have been doing.
[1291.30s -> 1294.62s]  They've been letting the companies do all the work of gathering
[1294.62s -> 1298.58s]  the data and organizing it and storing it and of course,
[1298.58s -> 1301.54s]  the companies apparently want to do that for their commercial
[1301.54s -> 1304.90s]  purposes and the government is saying, how about a free ride?
[1304.90s -> 1308.42s]  You know, we have some national security purposes as well.
[1308.74s -> 1316.02s]  The thing that has changed is the government is not interested
[1316.02s -> 1320.14s]  in so much anymore in just the voice communications,
[1320.14s -> 1322.38s]  which now are predominantly mobile.
[1322.38s -> 1325.82s]  It's interested in all this other data that the over-the-top
[1325.82s -> 1330.46s]  companies have learned how to gather, which is where am I and what
[1330.46s -> 1334.58s]  am I saying on Twitter and what am I saying in emails and what
[1334.58s -> 1338.22s]  have I saved, what pictures have I taken and where have I saved
[1338.22s -> 1341.14s]  those pictures and in other words, what am I doing,
[1341.14s -> 1344.78s]  what am I thinking and most importantly, what predictions
[1344.78s -> 1347.34s]  can be made about what I'm about to do.
[1347.34s -> 1352.30s]  All of that, which commercial companies have perfected so that
[1352.30s -> 1357.02s]  they can tell advertisers where to advertise, the government
[1357.02s -> 1360.10s]  is saying, if you can make those kinds of predictions then
[1360.10s -> 1363.66s]  that means you can help us make predictions about who's
[1363.70s -> 1368.46s]  about to commit crimes, some of them potentially really hideous.
[1368.46s -> 1373.70s]  All right, so clearly the over-the-top companies are
[1373.70s -> 1376.62s]  already collecting large amounts of data just for the
[1376.62s -> 1380.34s]  service that they provide and so they're a ripe source for
[1380.34s -> 1384.46s]  that information from law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
[1384.46s -> 1388.50s]  But the network equipment, the switches and routers that
[1388.50s -> 1391.34s]  make up the internet, they too can be, you know,
[1391.38s -> 1394.42s]  we can eavesdrop into them, you know, there's eavesdropping
[1394.42s -> 1397.18s]  capabilities that have to be put in anyway just to maintain
[1397.18s -> 1398.74s]  and have them work.
[1398.74s -> 1404.46s]  But are the builders of the equipment, are they responsible
[1404.46s -> 1408.66s]  for, are they required in any way to provide the means to,
[1408.66s -> 1412.58s]  you know, the back door to be able to listen to the communications?
[1412.58s -> 1419.30s]  Well, if you're asking whether there's a law or a regulation
[1420.30s -> 1425.14s]  that affects the design of routers or servers or, for that
[1425.14s -> 1430.26s]  matter, data centers so as to permit back doors, no is the
[1430.26s -> 1432.74s]  answer to that question, at least in the United States.
[1432.74s -> 1436.38s]  Is that the regime in China?
[1436.38s -> 1440.26s]  Well, that's the matter of a tremendous amount of debate
[1440.26s -> 1442.82s]  and the Chinese would say no and a lot of other people
[1442.82s -> 1445.70s]  would say the true answer in China is yes.
[1445.70s -> 1449.14s]  So you have to ask that question on a country
[1449.98s -> 1450.98s]  by country basis.
[1450.98s -> 1451.98s]  I see.
[1451.98s -> 1456.38s]  It's not, if I may say so, it's not really, I think, the most
[1456.38s -> 1462.10s]  important question because the big fact is that approximately
[1462.10s -> 1465.02s]  four firms that are headquartered in the United
[1465.02s -> 1469.78s]  States gather the overwhelming amount of over-the-top
[1469.78s -> 1474.46s]  information and they are storing it and organizing it for
[1474.46s -> 1478.18s]  their own commercial purposes and it's all there for the
[1478.22s -> 1481.86s]  government to tap into and according to newspaper
[1481.86s -> 1486.30s]  accounts, we don't, I don't have anything to go by but
[1486.30s -> 1491.70s]  that, the National Security Agency has persuaded those
[1491.70s -> 1494.66s]  companies to give access to the data or according to a
[1494.66s -> 1498.30s]  story two days ago, they didn't even ask, they just
[1498.30s -> 1500.66s]  went ahead and got access to the data.
[1500.66s -> 1501.66s]  Right.
[1501.66s -> 1502.66s]  Yes.
[1502.66s -> 1505.34s]  I mean, with hindsight, do you think that the
[1505.34s -> 1508.22s]  government should have played more of a positive role
[1508.22s -> 1515.58s]  earlier on to either introduce regulation for the
[1515.58s -> 1519.14s]  over-the-top industries to prevent that, either that
[1519.14s -> 1523.42s]  consolidation into just four companies or put in place
[1523.42s -> 1527.34s]  more guidelines on how that data was stored and how
[1527.34s -> 1530.14s]  much was stored and for what period?
[1530.14s -> 1534.14s]  Well, I would give no as my answer to both those
[1534.14s -> 1537.98s]  questions and I would just want to point out, for 20
[1537.98s -> 1541.82s]  straight years, the tech industry in the United
[1541.82s -> 1545.26s]  States and in most other countries but especially in
[1545.26s -> 1548.42s]  the United States has vigorously stood for the
[1548.42s -> 1552.18s]  proposition that the government should really not
[1552.18s -> 1555.58s]  ever tell it what to do on any topic whatsoever.
[1555.58s -> 1556.58s]  Right.
[1556.58s -> 1560.74s]  And the idea that the industry would have said, oh,
[1560.74s -> 1565.26s]  we could use some regulation about design and it's really
[1565.26s -> 1567.98s]  good if the government tells us when it might want to
[1567.98s -> 1571.58s]  have access to the information, that would have
[1571.58s -> 1579.26s]  produced a firestorm of opposition and hostility and
[1579.26s -> 1582.98s]  you have to ask, really, what would have been the
[1582.98s -> 1585.66s]  point?
[1585.66s -> 1588.70s]  Would anything be different if the government had over the
[1588.70s -> 1592.42s]  past 20 years regulated something about the design of
[1592.42s -> 1593.42s]  the internet?
[1593.42s -> 1596.46s]  I don't think anything would have been different.
[1596.46s -> 1599.06s]  You'd still be facing the exact same questions we're
[1599.06s -> 1602.94s]  now facing, which really boiled down to just one
[1602.94s -> 1603.94s]  question.
[1603.94s -> 1606.54s]  So if, for example, Google is going to gather all this
[1606.54s -> 1613.74s]  data, then why shouldn't a national security agency be
[1613.74s -> 1617.90s]  able to make a prediction about a potential bad actor's
[1617.90s -> 1622.46s]  bad acts that's just as accurate as a prediction Google
[1622.46s -> 1626.14s]  might make about what advertisers will appeal to that
[1626.14s -> 1630.14s]  person?
[1630.14s -> 1632.78s]  One area where the government seems to have got
[1632.78s -> 1637.30s]  involved, it's alleged that the national security agency
[1637.30s -> 1640.46s]  had influenced the data encryption standards to make
[1640.46s -> 1644.78s]  them weaker and easier for government to crack.
[1644.78s -> 1649.22s]  As a consequence, what do you think the consequences
[1649.22s -> 1652.50s]  should and will be on the degree to which we trust
[1652.50s -> 1654.74s]  our networks and the internet in general for our
[1654.74s -> 1657.14s]  secure communications?
[1657.14s -> 1659.78s]  What does it mean for the future of banking and
[1659.78s -> 1663.26s]  e-commerce and do you think this will have a long-term
[1663.26s -> 1665.78s]  detrimental effect?
[1665.78s -> 1671.58s]  I think that the tech industry has not been able to
[1671.58s -> 1677.82s]  design and implement security at any level of the
[1677.82s -> 1684.46s]  network in a way that's been satisfactory to anybody.
[1684.46s -> 1688.38s]  I would agree wholeheartedly with that.
[1688.38s -> 1692.90s]  Probably it would be worth looking at the eBay slash
[1692.90s -> 1697.62s]  PayPal paper that was just published yesterday, which
[1697.62s -> 1702.78s]  lays out a vision of the way an online monetary system
[1702.78s -> 1708.30s]  or online payment system actually could work and you
[1708.30s -> 1710.18s]  could be, you and your students could be the judge
[1710.18s -> 1714.58s]  of whether they've got a better idea about security.
[1714.58s -> 1717.34s]  But I would say this is a problem that remains to be
[1717.34s -> 1722.10s]  solved and unless it is solved in a public-private
[1722.10s -> 1724.98s]  consensual matter, then I think the future of the
[1724.98s -> 1731.82s]  internet is going to be less than it should be.
[1731.82s -> 1734.46s]  What do you think when we're making this interview,
[1734.46s -> 1738.74s]  it's just a few days after the breaking news about the
[1738.74s -> 1741.78s]  alleged US spying on Chancellor Merkel of Germany,
[1741.78s -> 1744.42s]  what do you think the international impact is going
[1744.42s -> 1748.50s]  to be of these revelations?
[1749.18s -> 1755.86s]  Well, when I first went to China in the late 1990s as a
[1755.86s -> 1761.30s]  member of the US government, I was advised that it would
[1761.30s -> 1765.38s]  probably be the case that my hotel room would be
[1765.38s -> 1767.90s]  entered when I left it and that people in the
[1767.90s -> 1770.82s]  Chinese government would examine everything they
[1770.82s -> 1774.78s]  could find there and if I left the computer, they
[1774.78s -> 1778.06s]  would get into the computer and see what they
[1778.06s -> 1780.34s]  could get out of it.
[1780.34s -> 1783.66s]  I would just like to say that they left the room
[1783.66s -> 1787.50s]  very neatly arranged but not in the same way that
[1787.50s -> 1790.26s]  I had left it.
[1790.26s -> 1794.46s]  And let me go on to say that there's nothing new
[1794.46s -> 1798.54s]  under the sun and as long as there have been
[1798.54s -> 1801.38s]  people in power, those people in power have
[1801.38s -> 1804.06s]  wondered what other people in power were doing
[1804.06s -> 1807.90s]  and have tried to find that out.
[1807.90s -> 1810.46s]  Clearly the allegations related to, the recent
[1810.46s -> 1816.18s]  allegations of listening into a foreign ally in
[1816.18s -> 1820.82s]  Germany with the ghosts of East Germany looming
[1820.82s -> 1825.74s]  large has particular implications and do you think
[1825.74s -> 1828.42s]  this will die down over the next few days or
[1828.42s -> 1830.86s]  weeks or do you think it will actually change the
[1830.86s -> 1834.90s]  way that we see privacy and the way in which
[1834.90s -> 1838.30s]  different countries spy on each other?
[1838.30s -> 1841.54s]  You know, a lot of people think that the debate
[1841.54s -> 1844.62s]  here is between privacy and security.
[1844.62s -> 1848.42s]  If you want to have security for everybody,
[1848.42s -> 1851.18s]  you need to interfere or impinge on other
[1851.18s -> 1853.02s]  people's privacy.
[1853.02s -> 1856.78s]  My own view, which is shaped by reading a great
[1856.78s -> 1860.06s]  book by the late Senator Daniel Patrick
[1860.06s -> 1862.46s]  Moynihan, a book called Secrecy, which was
[1862.46s -> 1865.90s]  published in 1998, my own view is that the real
[1865.90s -> 1871.14s]  issue is openness and closeness of public and
[1871.14s -> 1875.98s]  secret and that almost everything that government
[1875.98s -> 1881.74s]  does today which is secret really ought to be
[1881.74s -> 1885.30s]  public, not everything, but almost everything.
[1885.30s -> 1888.46s]  And I don't mean public in the sense of there
[1888.50s -> 1892.06s]  ought to be constant Twitter feeds of everything
[1892.06s -> 1894.46s]  the government is finding out, but I do mean that
[1894.46s -> 1897.18s]  governments everywhere ought to be more open
[1897.18s -> 1900.10s]  about what they are doing.
[1900.10s -> 1903.94s]  And if that were the case, then I believe that it
[1903.94s -> 1908.18s]  would be substantially easier for communities, the
[1908.18s -> 1910.98s]  citizens of the United States, for example, to
[1910.98s -> 1914.70s]  form a consensus about the appropriate limits of
[1914.74s -> 1919.90s]  security and the appropriate rights of privacy.
[1919.90s -> 1924.18s]  But the real enemy of freedom is secrecy.
[1924.18s -> 1926.46s]  Yeah, and I think that that's become very clear
[1926.46s -> 1929.98s]  in the last few months as suddenly we become
[1929.98s -> 1932.10s]  aware of many things which we may have
[1932.10s -> 1934.66s]  suspected were going on, but they're thrust
[1934.66s -> 1936.94s]  forward into the public debate.
[1936.94s -> 1940.14s]  And if nothing else, for sure, the quality of that
[1940.14s -> 1942.94s]  debate has improved tremendously in the last
[1942.98s -> 1944.90s]  few months because of the scrutiny that it's come
[1944.90s -> 1947.90s]  under and it's realizing what a lack of
[1947.90s -> 1949.82s]  transparency that has been in the past.
[1949.82s -> 1953.22s]  So I would agree very much with that sentiment.
[1953.22s -> 1956.46s]  So if you were magically put in the position to
[1956.46s -> 1960.78s]  be able to sort of take charge, I'm not quite
[1960.78s -> 1964.78s]  sure of what or of whom, what would be your
[1964.78s -> 1968.14s]  desire for how we would get to that place of
[1968.14s -> 1971.98s]  greater openness and transparency?
[1972.02s -> 1975.34s]  I think you have to do a number of different things.
[1975.34s -> 1980.06s]  So, for example, in the United States, according to
[1980.06s -> 1982.62s]  reporters who have gotten access to some of these
[1982.62s -> 1985.62s]  documents, there are well more than a million
[1985.62s -> 1990.46s]  people who have a security classification.
[1990.46s -> 1992.62s]  Well, if it's more than a million people who have
[1992.62s -> 1995.98s]  it, it's not worth very much.
[1995.98s -> 2000.94s]  Really, there should be almost no one who has
[2000.94s -> 2004.42s]  access to the kinds of conclusions that the
[2004.42s -> 2008.02s]  computers run by the National Security Agency
[2008.02s -> 2011.38s]  are able to draw about bad actors.
[2011.38s -> 2014.02s]  Second, those people should have terms of duty
[2014.02s -> 2016.66s]  of not more than five years so that we don't
[2016.66s -> 2020.42s]  empower by the power of secrets certain
[2020.42s -> 2022.86s]  individuals who have immense sway over
[2022.86s -> 2027.26s]  government and other and people in the private sector.
[2027.26s -> 2031.18s]  Third, the nature of the information gathered by
[2031.18s -> 2032.86s]  government ought to be open.
[2032.86s -> 2036.34s]  Not the details, but the generic categories.
[2036.34s -> 2038.38s]  They all ought to be known so that everyone
[2038.38s -> 2041.18s]  understands what the government is doing.
[2041.18s -> 2043.50s]  Again, not day by day or case by case,
[2043.50s -> 2046.26s]  but in the abstract.
[2046.26s -> 2051.02s]  And then fourth, any individual who the
[2051.02s -> 2055.54s]  government has targeted is going to need to be able
[2055.54s -> 2059.66s]  to get access if they're charged with a crime or
[2059.66s -> 2062.38s]  they're prosecuted, they're going to be able to,
[2062.38s -> 2064.90s]  they're going to need to get access to the
[2064.90s -> 2068.98s]  information the government used to target them.
[2068.98s -> 2071.30s]  Otherwise you're having trial by computer and
[2071.30s -> 2073.98s]  you're having trial by algorithm.
[2073.98s -> 2078.10s]  Now that concept assumes that you're innocent
[2078.10s -> 2081.02s]  until proven guilty, but it also goes a little
[2081.02s -> 2084.74s]  further and says the issue of proof of guilt
[2084.78s -> 2088.46s]  can't totally be left to the computers and the government.
[2088.46s -> 2091.58s]  It has to be that the defendant, the accused,
[2091.58s -> 2094.98s]  also has access to that same information and that
[2094.98s -> 2098.46s]  same data bank if the charges are brought.
[2098.46s -> 2104.26s]  That balance doesn't right now exist in American law.
[2104.26s -> 2108.82s]  Are you confident, optimistic that the current
[2108.82s -> 2111.82s]  debate will help move us in that direction?
[2112.82s -> 2114.86s]  Yes, I am.
[2114.86s -> 2118.30s]  I think it's been, I think that the news stories
[2118.30s -> 2122.02s]  have been immensely helpful.
[2122.02s -> 2125.26s]  I take with a grain of salt some of the
[2125.26s -> 2129.30s]  protestations of foreign leaders who are shocked
[2129.30s -> 2131.42s]  and shocked and shocked to find out that there's
[2131.42s -> 2134.06s]  spying that's been going on.
[2134.06s -> 2136.70s]  I guess for the first time in history this has
[2136.70s -> 2138.74s]  been going on, is there a view?
[2138.78s -> 2144.42s]  But I think that overall the revelations are leading
[2144.42s -> 2148.18s]  to an open debate about that which ought to be open.
[2149.70s -> 2153.50s]  With that, I thank you very much and particularly
[2153.50s -> 2156.78s]  thank you for keeping this debate alive and for
[2156.78s -> 2158.62s]  your participation in it.
[2158.62s -> 2160.70s]  It certainly helped raise the quality of the debate
[2160.70s -> 2162.42s]  and discussion over the last few months.
[2162.42s -> 2163.46s]  Thank you, Nick.
[2163.46s -> 2165.46s]  It's an honor to talk with you about it, Reid.
[2165.46s -> 2166.38s]  Thank you, Nick.
[2166.38s -> 2168.58s]  Good to be with you and all of your clients.
