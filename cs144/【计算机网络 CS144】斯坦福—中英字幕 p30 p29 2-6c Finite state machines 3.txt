[0.00s -> 5.10s]  The answer to the first question is Fin Wait 1.
[5.10s -> 6.54s]  Let's walk through why.
[6.54s -> 12.28s]  We start in the close state, then the user program calls listen.
[12.28s -> 17.30s]  We transition to the listen state, then the socket receives a sin, and we transition
[17.30s -> 20.26s]  to the sin receive state.
[20.26s -> 24.62s]  While in the sin receive state, the user program calls close, so we traverse the
[24.62s -> 29.48s]  edge with close as an event to the Fin Wait 1 state.
