[0.00s -> 5.32s]  So here, I'm with John Peterson, who's an old friend of mine, and actually a pretty
[5.32s -> 13.84s]  important person in the internet, and we thought we'd ask John a bit about what's going
[13.84s -> 17.36s]  on today, some particularly interesting topics, but maybe we should start with, so how did
[17.36s -> 20.00s]  you get involved in internet governance?
[20.00s -> 22.12s]  That's a good question.
[22.12s -> 27.64s]  So I was lucky enough to be around in the early dot com boom in the late 1990s, and
[27.64s -> 32.80s]  a small startup that I worked for in Boston was acquired by Level 3 Communications.
[32.80s -> 38.04s]  They moved me out to scenic Boulder, Colorado, where Phil actually was as well, roughly the
[38.04s -> 44.76s]  same time, and Level 3 of course is one of the tier one backbone providers of the internet,
[44.76s -> 48.12s]  and they have a profound engagement with the internet engineering task force and the
[48.12s -> 53.96s]  standards bodies that help to make the internet, to define how the internet works,
[53.96s -> 58.20s]  and when I got there, that was one of the things actually that most attracted me about
[58.20s -> 63.20s]  this opportunity, would be the ability to really work with the top minds who were
[63.20s -> 68.24s]  out there, and so I started attending the ITF, I'd been on mailing lists and things
[68.24s -> 75.44s]  like that beforehand, but I first started attending when I worked at Level 3, and I
[75.44s -> 81.28s]  just found it to be a fascinating community that had such intellectual rigor, that just
[81.28s -> 85.48s]  had so much interest in trying to find the right solution.
[85.48s -> 91.40s]  You don't go to the ITF and represent a company, you go there and you put forward
[91.40s -> 95.64s]  what you think is the best idea, and it's really a place where there is a meritocracy
[95.64s -> 100.54s]  of ideas, and once you get the bug forward, of course, you discover there are all these
[100.54s -> 105.60s]  other dimensions to internet governance, if you're there at the ITF, you may end up dealing
[105.60s -> 110.24s]  with the W3C, if you work on applications, as they have responsibility for the standards
[110.24s -> 115.84s]  associated with the World Wide Web, like HTML, you may end up working with ICANN, with
[115.84s -> 121.52s]  the people that do domain name assignments, and I kind of made the rounds of these internet
[121.52s -> 126.36s]  governance circles, and working on the intersection between technology and public policy tends
[126.36s -> 128.36s]  to take you to some pretty interesting places.
[128.36s -> 134.80s]  Well, so the first work that you did with SIP, the Session Initiation Protocol, do you
[134.80s -> 140.04s]  want to talk a little bit about this IP telephony and what that path was, and where SIP
[140.04s -> 142.04s]  is today and what your part in it was?
[142.04s -> 146.84s]  Sure, it's important to remember that in the early 1990s, there really wasn't anything
[146.84s -> 153.08s]  like voice over IP, there were some experimental technologies people had rigged up that worked
[153.08s -> 156.72s]  in some of the unique environments in labs in California and so on, but there was no
[156.72s -> 161.92s]  commercial product you could buy that would let you talk to somebody else over the internet.
[161.92s -> 166.84s]  Remember as well that in the mid 1990s, a lot of computers didn't have adequate
[166.84s -> 172.28s]  sound cards, there certainly wasn't adequate video capture, and you know, network interfaces
[172.28s -> 180.28s]  were spotty at best, and the actual commercial services you could purchase, especially at
[180.28s -> 184.40s]  the consumer level, to get enough bandwidth to communicate over the internet with something
[184.40s -> 186.20s]  like voice over IP, they didn't really exist.
[186.20s -> 191.32s]  So sometime around 1996, 1997, we hit a sweet spot where the computing power was
[191.32s -> 196.24s]  there, the network was there, computers tended to have the right interfaces to do this,
[196.24s -> 201.24s]  and so we started to see the first commercial voice over IP offerings around that time.
[201.24s -> 207.52s]  When I started working on this around then, 96, 97, I worked on the infrastructure dimension
[207.52s -> 208.52s]  of this.
[208.52s -> 212.24s]  The startup that I worked for in Boston was focused on the particular problem of how
[212.24s -> 217.14s]  you could take a traditional telephone switch, and these telephone switches, made by companies
[217.14s -> 223.60s]  like Nortel and at the time Lucent, they were enormous, expensive, monolithic, special
[223.60s -> 230.08s]  purpose devices that required a ton of operational oversight, didn't really fit into the internet
[230.08s -> 236.28s]  software model or the internet disruptive innovation that we all associate with technology
[236.28s -> 241.28s]  today, and so I was one of the first people to work on something called soft switching,
[241.28s -> 246.68s]  the idea that you could just take a general purpose computer, take a sun box, a unix box,
[246.68s -> 251.96s]  and put the control plane logic for a telephone switch on a box like that, and just have
[251.96s -> 257.28s]  it control telephone resources that actually handled switching literal circuits from one
[257.28s -> 261.12s]  customer to another, to handle those as dumb devices.
[261.12s -> 268.36s]  This created an extremely disruptive influence on the telephone switch market, and today,
[268.36s -> 271.92s]  I think it would be safe to say that it's become a dominant paradigm, and that you
[271.92s -> 276.82s]  actually can't really buy things like these Nortel switches anymore, except on the secondary
[276.82s -> 277.82s]  market.
[277.82s -> 281.16s]  If you own one and you need replacement parts today, you pretty much have to get
[281.16s -> 286.64s]  them on eBay if you need new line cards and things like that.
[286.64s -> 291.52s]  Once you build a soft switch, naturally, these sun boxes or other unix boxes, they
[291.52s -> 296.64s]  have internet access, and you need to have ways for these switches to talk to one another,
[296.64s -> 302.44s]  to be able to coordinate calls that don't use the outdated x25-based SS7 systems.
[302.44s -> 307.16s]  They're used in the traditional telephone network, and that's where tools like SIP started
[307.16s -> 308.16s]  to come into play.
[308.48s -> 313.78s]  A lot of my early work on the session initiation protocol was on telephony replacement, was
[313.78s -> 319.96s]  on how you would be able to not touch that traditional network, but instead do all
[319.96s -> 325.78s]  of this over the internet, to be able to set up calls at the end.
[325.78s -> 330.16s]  This turned out to be a pretty important dimension of adopting voice over IP protocol.
[330.16s -> 333.64s]  It's one thing to build a tool that lets you talk to anybody else who happened to
[333.64s -> 339.56s]  have a good computer in the 1990s and similar technology that you have, but a very different
[339.56s -> 343.32s]  matter to be able to call someone who's actually on the telephone network with a real telephone
[343.32s -> 344.32s]  number.
[344.32s -> 347.72s]  These soft switches became bridges between the traditional telephone network and people
[347.72s -> 349.64s]  in the voice over IP space.
[349.64s -> 354.48s]  These have been essential going forward to how voice over IP has become successful, to
[354.48s -> 359.32s]  the ability for programs like, say, Skype today, to be able to call out from your
[359.32s -> 362.88s]  PC to someone who has a normal landline platform.
[363.56s -> 368.56s]  Also, one of the things that you worked on in the more refined versions of SIP was its
[368.56s -> 369.56s]  security model.
[369.56s -> 372.24s]  How do you actually secure the signaling protocol?
[372.24s -> 379.28s]  As I'm sure you can imagine, given some of the recent events in the internet with
[379.28s -> 383.08s]  respect to the Snowden releases, there's an interesting question.
[383.08s -> 389.24s]  Do you see something about the implications of stuff like SIP and security with respect
[389.24s -> 393.64s]  to then PSTN, wiretapping laws, all those kinds of questions?
[393.64s -> 395.00s]  Where do you think this is going?
[395.00s -> 396.00s]  How is it different?
[396.00s -> 397.00s]  Wow.
[397.00s -> 398.00s]  Big question.
[398.00s -> 404.20s]  I do recall when we were building the RFC for SIP, RFC 3261, we basically drew straws
[404.20s -> 406.40s]  for who's going to do what parts.
[406.40s -> 411.04s]  I got to write the overview of how SIP operated with a one paragraph statement.
[411.04s -> 416.28s]  I got to do addressing, I got to do user agent behavior, and then I drew the straw
[416.28s -> 417.28s]  to do security.
[417.28s -> 418.28s]  Okay.
[418.32s -> 422.60s]  I have a bit of a security background, this shouldn't be too difficult.
[422.60s -> 427.56s]  The initial plan, one section on security in SIP actually ended up being four chapters
[427.56s -> 428.56s]  of the RFC.
[428.56s -> 435.56s]  At the time, this was the largest RFC ever published, and SIP did not come out then.
[435.56s -> 440.68s]  SIP security has always been a problem child.
[440.68s -> 446.88s]  These revelations obviously input the IT app and the people who develop standards in very
[446.92s -> 449.92s]  interesting positions.
[449.92s -> 453.80s]  No less an authority than Bruce Schneier, who I would say is one of the greatest minds
[453.80s -> 459.32s]  thinking today about security, has formally called on the IT app to drop what it's doing
[459.32s -> 464.20s]  and to refocus all of its efforts in our upcoming meeting, which will be in Vancouver
[464.20s -> 472.92s]  this November, on how we're going to resolve the problems that have been raised by PRISM.
[472.96s -> 477.52s]  We've studied the privacy properties of these protocols, the security properties of these
[477.52s -> 481.96s]  protocols very extensively.
[481.96s -> 487.40s]  I'm as convinced now, I think as I ever was, that we made a lot of compromises in
[487.40s -> 495.16s]  the design of SIP security because they were necessary for it to be adopted in the marketplace.
[495.16s -> 498.80s]  It would be great to be able to design a protocol that had and then security that
[498.80s -> 503.36s]  can guarantee integrity and confidentiality between one endpoint that's trying to make
[503.36s -> 505.96s]  a call and another endpoint that's trying to make a call.
[505.96s -> 510.52s]  As soon as intermediaries are playing some role in the delivery of that, as soon as
[510.52s -> 516.76s]  they need to help you to find the right endpoint, and this dynamic capability that
[516.76s -> 522.52s]  SIP has to allow, if I wanted to have five devices that would all register under
[522.52s -> 529.32s]  my SIP name, a desk phone, a cell phone, my iPad, various other devices, they all need
[529.32s -> 533.20s]  to register to some server that's in the network somewhere that's going to be responsible
[533.20s -> 534.68s]  for routing traffic to it.
[534.68s -> 540.84s]  The degree to which that server has access to signaling, has access to who's calling
[540.84s -> 546.40s]  me, what are the media streams that are going to be set up, and what are the IP endpoints
[546.40s -> 550.60s]  that media is going to be sent between.
[550.60s -> 557.72s]  We could have done more to protect that when we designed SIP, and I think if we had, we
[557.72s -> 561.72s]  wouldn't be talking about SIP right now, because it wouldn't have succeeded enough
[561.72s -> 563.80s]  for it to even be noteworthy.
[563.80s -> 567.28s]  So what are some, can you talk a little bit about, so SIP might be a protocol that
[567.28s -> 570.28s]  most people don't realize that they're using or where it's being used, you just
[570.28s -> 572.68s]  want to talk a little bit about where it's been successful and where it's been really
[572.68s -> 573.68s]  adopted?
[573.68s -> 574.68s]  Sure.
[574.68s -> 579.44s]  So I mentioned Skype, if you do Skype in or Skype out, typically that is Skype's internal
[579.44s -> 586.40s]  protocols converted into SIP for transfer to a gateway, which would then go to the telephone
[586.40s -> 587.40s]  network.
[587.40s -> 595.72s]  Basically, if you use a voice for IP service or a landline in your house that comes from
[595.72s -> 601.20s]  either FiOS or from a cable provider, that's surely SIP that is being used in the background.
[601.20s -> 606.76s]  The third generation cell phones, things that are 3G, PQ gates, all use SIP signaling
[606.76s -> 607.76s]  inside them.
[607.76s -> 613.12s]  Now, I mean, these networks, especially when we talk about mobile phones and about the
[613.12s -> 619.08s]  networks we see and the cable NSOs and so on, they use a version of SIP that is relatively
[619.08s -> 621.40s]  architecturally similar to the telephone network.
[621.40s -> 626.24s]  They kind of apply the protocol machinery of SIP to generating a system that has many
[626.24s -> 629.28s]  of the same properties that the telephone network has.
[629.28s -> 633.20s]  And this too is, it's a fundamental trade-off inside of these things.
[633.20s -> 642.20s]  I would love to see a SIP that was much less dependent on the network elements shaping
[642.20s -> 646.88s]  traffic and deciding how, but it was much more driven by the endpoints.
[646.88s -> 650.80s]  This is just kind of a fundamental and end principle of the internet, that you want to
[650.80s -> 652.68s]  have the smarts be on the endpoints.
[652.68s -> 656.56s]  You don't want to have an intermediary in the middle need to understand what endpoints
[656.56s -> 657.56s]  want to do.
[657.56s -> 659.24s]  It shouldn't get in their way.
[659.24s -> 660.76s]  It shouldn't prevent them from negotiating.
[661.28s -> 665.36s]  If I may have a great new codec tomorrow and I have a copy of it and you have a copy of it,
[665.36s -> 668.20s]  it sits on our G-machines, I don't want that thing in the middle of the network
[668.20s -> 674.12s]  to have to know anything about that codec to let us connect and to use it.
[674.12s -> 677.76s]  The realities, though, of how these things actually get implemented, especially when you're
[677.76s -> 683.72s]  doing something as complex as replacing the telephone network, replacing more than a century-old
[683.72s -> 689.24s]  system with its reliability constraints, with its emergency services implications, so the
[689.24s -> 692.04s]  ability to call 911.
[692.04s -> 700.20s]  Just getting the basic services people associate with this right, it requires you to make compromises.
[700.20s -> 704.60s]  I can't say I'm always proud in retrospect of the compromises we needed to make in order
[704.60s -> 710.40s]  for this to be successful, but I do acknowledge in retrospect that if we had pushed back
[710.40s -> 716.04s]  on some of those compromises, it certainly would have led to the death of the protocol.
[716.04s -> 720.24s]  As people who design standards, this is a heartbreaking thing that you come up against
[720.24s -> 721.84s]  again and again.
[721.84s -> 724.40s]  We can be smarter about this.
[724.40s -> 731.08s]  I think if there is a silver lining to these increasingly disturbing revelations
[731.08s -> 736.48s]  that are coming up about widespread state surveillance of the internet, it may create
[736.48s -> 742.80s]  a political will to see a change in what we can get consensus for and hopefully in
[742.80s -> 745.16s]  what people will be willing to deploy.
[745.28s -> 749.36s]  I believe when you go to the ITF, since it is consensus-based, there are things we could
[749.36s -> 753.20s]  get consensus to do that I think would be very radical at this point because the people
[753.20s -> 756.80s]  who go to the ITF are so well-informed, they're so energized, they're so interested
[756.80s -> 759.40s]  in individual liberties.
[759.40s -> 763.72s]  I would hate to see the ITF, though, become an organization that is developing standards
[763.72s -> 768.96s]  that never see the light of day because it has swung too far in this direction.
[768.96s -> 773.20s]  It's very difficult for us to understand what the right course is for us to chart
[773.20s -> 774.20s]  at this point.
[774.24s -> 775.24s]  Interesting.
[775.24s -> 776.24s]  Interesting.
[776.24s -> 778.24s]  I'd like to wind back a little bit.
[778.24s -> 783.24s]  You mentioned about how building the first soft switch where devices and all the logic
[783.24s -> 790.36s]  is in the general computer, at that point it hardens from the sun box, but do you
[790.36s -> 794.68s]  see a parallel between that and then software-defined networking today where we see that transition
[794.68s -> 800.68s]  maybe happening in the internet and some of the momentum that's occurring behind SDN?
[800.68s -> 802.56s]  I certainly see many parallels there.
[802.60s -> 807.04s]  I'm not sure those parallels will play out in exactly the same way because companies
[807.04s -> 812.64s]  like Cisco and Juniper that would stand to be disrupted by this the way that, say, Nortel
[812.64s -> 817.08s]  and Lucint were in the 90s, they are more agile companies.
[817.08s -> 823.64s]  They are companies that are taking these technologies and trying to figure out a middle
[823.64s -> 825.48s]  path, I guess.
[825.48s -> 829.92s]  For example, there is the I2RS, the interface to the routing system, a standard proposal
[829.92s -> 832.08s]  circulating in the ITF now.
[832.12s -> 836.64s]  It's a bit different than the very low layer software-defined networking approach that
[836.64s -> 842.88s]  we see, say, in the Open Networking Foundation, but it's nonetheless a way that software
[842.88s -> 849.52s]  can interact with the FIB and help higher-level routing decisions get made.
[849.52s -> 856.56s]  I think the routing vendors view this as one tool among many that will help decide
[856.56s -> 858.92s]  how packets are going to be forwarded.
[858.92s -> 864.20s]  They're figuring out ways, in other words, to subsume this that will allow their device
[864.20s -> 869.92s]  to take advantage of the strengths of this without necessarily eroding the market control
[869.92s -> 875.96s]  and the lengthy install base they have of maintenance tools and so on that have proven
[875.96s -> 879.48s]  so successful for the internet in the past.
[879.48s -> 887.28s]  I don't know that core routers have, to the degree that old telephone switches did,
[887.28s -> 889.92s]  competed innovation in the network as well.
[889.92s -> 896.08s]  And that was another real driver for doing soft switching, was that these traditional
[896.08s -> 901.92s]  telephone switches were so monolithic, they had no programmability, there were no realistic
[901.92s -> 908.96s]  interfaces that you could use to alter their behavior without doing open-heart surgery.
[908.96s -> 915.92s]  The situation is very different, I think, for core routers, but the parallels, they do stand.
[915.92s -> 920.48s]  I certainly wouldn't dismiss it out of hand, and I certainly know people who work for major
[920.48s -> 924.24s]  router vendors who, if you find them at the bar at the right hour, will cry on your
[924.24s -> 929.76s]  shoulder, not exactly their concerns about this, and it is a real challenge for that
[929.76s -> 930.76s]  business.
[930.76s -> 931.76s]  Interesting.
[931.76s -> 935.80s]  Well, so, if you were to look at all the different pieces of work, how many working
[935.80s -> 937.44s]  groups are in the IETF today?
[937.44s -> 943.12s]  Off the top of my head, I'm not sure I could say, or a quarter of a hundred, yeah.
[943.12s -> 949.24s]  So if you were to think, what's the sort of suggest to somebody, hey, this is maybe
[949.24s -> 951.92s]  something you should keep your eye on, is what I think is some of the most interesting
[951.92s -> 957.24s]  work going on on the internet, so stuff which is currently in progress and might really
[957.24s -> 962.16s]  significantly change what the network's like in three or so years, where would
[962.16s -> 963.16s]  you suggest looking?
[963.16s -> 968.52s]  Well, actually, that I2RS group would be a very significant one that I point to right
[968.52s -> 969.52s]  now.
[969.52s -> 971.28s]  There is a new effort that's just been spun up.
[971.28s -> 974.44s]  It's unclear if it's going to be a working group or not.
[974.44s -> 980.92s]  It's called PerPass, which is the IETF's forum for discussing PRISM and for discussing how
[980.92s -> 982.76s]  these security things are going to be addressed.
[982.76s -> 987.40s]  There are already some proposals that are circulating there that are really about structural
[987.40s -> 993.64s]  changes to how the IETF process would work, for should standards have to meet a new bar
[993.64s -> 1000.20s]  basically in order to obviate the very real concerns that are increasingly coming
[1000.20s -> 1002.00s]  to light about all of this.
[1002.00s -> 1005.76s]  If you were coming to Vancouver this time, these are two things I'd certainly come
[1005.76s -> 1006.76s]  to.
[1006.76s -> 1010.36s]  There are things I personally happen to be working on that I think are very interesting
[1010.36s -> 1016.40s]  and impactful that might not set to exactly that level, but I continue to be very
[1016.40s -> 1023.44s]  interested in CDNs and the degree of internet traffic that is now being directed by
[1023.44s -> 1025.36s]  content distribution networks.
[1025.36s -> 1030.60s]  We're doing a lot of work today on interfaces for understanding how CDNs can express
[1030.60s -> 1038.12s]  their coverage areas and how CDNs can advertise services that they provide in order
[1038.12s -> 1044.56s]  to allow collaboration or clearing houses among CDNs to make more optimal selections
[1044.56s -> 1046.36s]  of CDNs.
[1046.36s -> 1051.16s]  I think this will have potentially a tremendous impact on the efficiency of internet
[1051.16s -> 1055.60s]  traffic or alleviate some of the bottlenecks that people predict as more and more video
[1055.60s -> 1060.96s]  moves on to the internet, a personal pet project of mine.
[1060.96s -> 1065.32s]  I am also still working on some things related to the intersection of the telephone
[1065.32s -> 1069.08s]  network and the internet.
[1069.08s -> 1076.08s]  One thing that's been, I think, a major issue in robocalling has become an increasing
[1076.08s -> 1082.08s]  problem as the internet and the telephone network have become more interconnected.
[1082.08s -> 1088.24s]  Right now, I'm looking at ways that perhaps we can do better identity services, so it's
[1088.24s -> 1089.80s]  harder to spoof calls.
[1089.80s -> 1094.00s]  It's easier to find out who's responsible for a telephone call coming off the internet
[1094.00s -> 1098.92s]  before it hits the PSTN as the numbers for this are just going up and up and up.
[1098.92s -> 1102.92s]  The FTC and the FCC are profoundly interested in finding a solution for this.
[1102.92s -> 1107.08s]  This is work that is being discussed in congressional subcommittees already as it's going on in
[1107.08s -> 1108.08s]  the ITF.
[1108.08s -> 1112.24s]  That's a place where I think we can really make a difference in something that is hurting
[1112.24s -> 1116.20s]  consumers and will be a big deal going forward.
[1116.20s -> 1122.00s]  If we stop proceeding robocalls, then we have you to thank.
[1122.00s -> 1123.00s]  Thanks for coming by.
[1123.00s -> 1124.00s]  Thanks for your time.
[1124.00s -> 1125.00s]  My pleasure.
[1125.00s -> 1126.00s]  Thank you.
[1126.00s -> 1126.02s]  Bye.
