[0.00s -> 5.80s]  So in this unit, we're going to finally dig down below IP, answer the question, what
[5.80s -> 8.52s]  is a link and how do they work?
[8.52s -> 11.96s]  So how does the link layer work and what are the issues that you encounter at the
[11.96s -> 12.96s]  link layer?
[12.96s -> 16.20s]  And so there are two basic things that this unit is going to cover.
[16.20s -> 19.68s]  The first are the fundamental principles of communication.
[19.68s -> 23.48s]  This is sort of the boundary of computer science and networking with electrical engineering.
[23.48s -> 28.00s]  We're going to talk about things like signal and noise and how the signal to noise
[28.00s -> 32.20s]  ratio in fact determines what's the potential bit rate capacity of a link.
[32.20s -> 37.24s]  I mean, there's a reason why today we don't have 100 terabit per second link layers because
[37.24s -> 41.12s]  of some of these fundamental mathematical principles of communication.
[41.12s -> 44.66s]  So based on that, we're going to look at things like bit errors and how link layers
[44.66s -> 48.64s]  can recover from them using coding, error correcting codes.
[48.64s -> 52.14s]  So that, for example, you add a little bit of redundancy to your link layer frames
[52.14s -> 55.84s]  such that if there are a few bit errors down at the physical link layer, you can
[55.84s -> 58.84s]  recover from them and still receive the frame correctly.
[58.84s -> 62.56s]  So the second thing that we're going to be learning about in this unit are how these
[62.56s -> 64.68s]  links are actually built.
[64.68s -> 70.92s]  You'll remember from unit one, we learned that the thin waste of IP allows many, many
[70.92s -> 76.04s]  physical layers or link layers to operate underneath and still use the internet protocol
[76.04s -> 78.24s]  and to tie them all together.
[78.24s -> 81.80s]  So there are different categories of physical links and we're going to be talking about
[81.80s -> 84.76s]  two here, two that you'll be very familiar with already.
[84.76s -> 89.28s]  There's wired links, for which the dominant wired link in use today is ethernet.
[89.28s -> 91.20s]  So we'll be learning how ethernet works.
[91.20s -> 96.16s]  The original version of ethernet used a shared cable and so needed a way to share that
[96.16s -> 101.44s]  cable and so we'll be learning about what's called the CSMA-CD protocol or access
[101.44s -> 105.72s]  control mechanism that allows us to share that physical cable.
[105.72s -> 110.60s]  But we'll learn also how ethernet works today, which is to use switches and we learned
[110.60s -> 114.76s]  a little bit about those already in the previous unit, how they learn addresses and
[114.76s -> 117.52s]  how those tables get populated.
[117.52s -> 122.12s]  The second thing we'll be learning under the links is wireless links.
[122.12s -> 126.68s]  Now wireless is quite different from wired, more than just the fact that it's broadcast
[126.68s -> 127.68s]  into the air.
[127.68s -> 131.16s]  There are so many, many characteristics of wireless that make it fundamentally different
[131.16s -> 132.16s]  in the way that it works.
[132.16s -> 136.24s]  So we need to be mindful of these when making practical links.
[136.24s -> 141.88s]  The first one is that the signal itself in the channel can vary.
[141.88s -> 146.00s]  It's not fixed over time like it is in a wired link where it always has the same capacity
[146.00s -> 147.74s]  operating on the same link.
[147.74s -> 151.96s]  The channel can fade, there can be different types of interference, signals can take different
[151.96s -> 155.40s]  paths of different links and interfere with itself.
[155.40s -> 159.32s]  And because it's broadcast, everybody can hear and so this introduces some challenges
[159.32s -> 165.56s]  as well, as well as security challenges because everybody can hear what they're saying.
[165.56s -> 169.32s]  There's another type of problem that we'll learn about called the hidden terminal problem.
[169.32s -> 175.56s]  This is when two clients that are communicating are both talking to an AP, they can happily
[175.56s -> 178.72s]  talk to an AP, but they have no means to communicate to each other because they
[178.72s -> 181.76s]  don't have any direct signal contact with each other.
[181.76s -> 186.16s]  And so there needs to be some extra level of coordination in the network to make sure
[186.16s -> 190.84s]  that they don't interfere with each other at the access point.
[190.84s -> 194.32s]  Also in addition to learning about these different types of link, we'll be learning
[194.32s -> 198.36s]  about one of the consequences of having these different links and that is different links
[198.36s -> 203.36s]  can carry packets up to a different maximum size, the so-called maximum transmission unit.
[203.36s -> 207.84s]  Ethernet for example can take packets up to 1500 bytes long, but other links may
[207.84s -> 211.40s]  take packets only up to a certain length.
[211.40s -> 217.80s]  And so you probably remember that we've mentioned IP fragmentation in earlier parts of the class.
[217.80s -> 222.12s]  This is necessary when you're going from a link with a large maximum transmission
[222.12s -> 226.52s]  unit down to a smaller one, because it's not able to carry it, the network will fragment
[226.52s -> 231.08s]  it into a number of self-contained fragments that don't get put back together again until
[231.08s -> 236.48s]  you get to the end host, which then reassembles the data and hands it up to the next layer.
[236.48s -> 242.48s]  So you'll learn how that works and what the specific mechanisms are inside IP to make that work.
[242.48s -> 245.08s]  The last thing that we're going to be learning about is sort of an interesting tricky
[245.08s -> 250.76s]  little detail of the communication channel, and that is that when two hosts or two ends
[250.80s -> 255.60s]  of a link are communicating with each other, they can't possibly be using exactly the same clock.
[255.60s -> 262.60s]  You can't have exactly the same frequency, exactly the same phase at two different places at the same time.
[262.60s -> 266.20s]  So when a sender is sending, it's using one clock, which is potentially different from the one
[266.20s -> 271.40s]  the receiver is using. So somehow we need to indicate to the receiver what clock rate
[271.40s -> 276.80s]  and frequency and phase that we were using in order for the far end to correctly decode the data.
[276.80s -> 282.84s]  So we'll learn about encoding in order to be able to recover the clock and use it correctly at the far end.
