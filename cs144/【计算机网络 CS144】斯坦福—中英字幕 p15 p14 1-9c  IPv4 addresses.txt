[0.00s -> 2.54s]  Let's walk through the answers.
[2.54s -> 4.38s]  The answer to the first row is no.
[4.38s -> 5.82s]  They are in different networks.
[5.82s -> 9.62s]  The two addresses differ in their second octet, 34 vs 35.
[9.62s -> 18.12s]  If we take a bitwise AND of the two addresses with a netmask, we get 128.34.0.0 and 128.35.0.0,
[18.12s -> 20.26s]  which are not the same.
[20.26s -> 22.30s]  The answer to the second row is yes.
[22.30s -> 23.30s]  They are in the same network.
[23.30s -> 31.64s]  If we take a bitwise AND of the two addresses with a netmask, we get 10.0.1.0 in both cases.
[31.64s -> 33.42s]  The answer to the third row is no.
[33.42s -> 37.10s]  They are not in the same network, because they differ in their third octet.
[37.10s -> 44.36s]  The source is in network 10.0.1.0 and the destination is in network 10.0.2.0.
[44.36s -> 47.02s]  The answer to the fourth row is no.
[47.02s -> 48.98s]  They are not in the same network.
[48.98s -> 54.06s]  When ended with a netmask, the source address is 171.64.15.32, while the destination
[54.06s -> 57.62s]  is 171.64.15.0.
[57.62s -> 59.42s]  The answer to the final row is yes.
[59.42s -> 60.86s]  They match on the first byte.
[60.86s -> 64.50s]  Both are 171.0.0.0 when ended with a netmask.
