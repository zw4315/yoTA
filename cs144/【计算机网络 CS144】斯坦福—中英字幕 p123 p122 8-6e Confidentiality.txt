[0.00s -> 5.82s]  So here's a second quiz. Suppose I decide I want to make Bluefish faster and so cut
[5.82s -> 11.62s]  it to just one iteration. I feed it two plaintext blocks. The first plaintext block is all
[11.62s -> 18.86s]  zeros, which somehow my adversary knows. It produces the first ciphertext shown here.
[18.86s -> 25.10s]  I feed the second ciphertext block, which produces the second ciphertext, shown here.
[25.10s -> 28.82s]  That is the value of L0 in the second plaintext block.
