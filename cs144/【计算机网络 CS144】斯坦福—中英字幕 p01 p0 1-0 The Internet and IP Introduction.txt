[0.00s -> 6.00s]  Welcome to the first unit. This is the unit where you'll learn the big picture, as well as a few details.
[6.00s -> 9.00s]  You're going to learn the basics of how the Internet works.
[9.00s -> 13.00s]  You might even get to figure out which one of us is Nick and which one of us is Phil.
[13.00s -> 17.00s]  We hope to help you understand why the Internet is designed the way that it is,
[17.00s -> 19.00s]  what are some of its strengths and its weaknesses.
[19.00s -> 23.00s]  We'll also teach you some of the commonly accepted network design principles,
[23.00s -> 26.00s]  such as layering, encapsulation, and packet switching.
[26.00s -> 29.00s]  At the end of this unit, you should be able to answer questions like,
[29.00s -> 32.00s]  what is the Internet? What is an Internet address?
[32.00s -> 36.00s]  And how do applications such as the Web, Skype, and BitTorrent work?
[36.00s -> 40.00s]  These principles will help you design better networks in the future.
[40.00s -> 45.00s]  At the end of this first unit, you should be familiar with something called the four-layer model of the Internet.
[45.00s -> 49.00s]  It describes how the Internet is broken down into four distinct layers.
[49.00s -> 54.00s]  You'll learn what those layers are and why they're a basic principle of good network design.
[54.00s -> 57.00s]  You'll learn what the Internet's four layers are and how they work together.
[57.00s -> 62.00s]  You'll learn that most applications use a transport layer called the Transmission Control Protocol,
[62.00s -> 66.00s]  or TCP, and how some applications use it.
[66.00s -> 71.00s]  You'll also learn that the Internet works by breaking up data into small units called packets.
[71.00s -> 75.00s]  For example, when you request a web page, your computer sends some packets to the web server.
[75.00s -> 80.00s]  The Internet decides how those packets of data arrive to the right destination.
[80.00s -> 84.00s]  So this unit also examines one layer in particular in greater detail.
[84.00s -> 86.00s]  It's the network layer.
[86.00s -> 88.00s]  You might have heard of IP, the Internet Protocol.
[88.00s -> 93.00s]  It's the protocol named after the Internet because it's the glue that lets the whole thing work.
[93.00s -> 97.00s]  You can change all of the other layers, but to be using the Internet,
[97.00s -> 101.00s]  you need to be using the Internet Protocol at the network layer.
[101.00s -> 105.00s]  You'll learn about what the Internet Protocol does and how it does it.
[105.00s -> 109.00s]  You'll learn about the Internet Protocol addresses and how they're assigned.
[109.00s -> 114.00s]  You'll start to learn how the Internet decides the path a packet should take based on its Internet address.
[114.00s -> 120.00s]  Finally, I'll show you a few software tools that you can use to inspect how your computer is using the Internet.
[120.00s -> 125.00s]  So you can apply what you've learned in this unit the next time you browse the web.
