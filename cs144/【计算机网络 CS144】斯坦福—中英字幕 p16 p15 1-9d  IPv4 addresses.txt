[0.00s -> 3.12s]  So, how are IP addresses assigned?
[3.12s -> 7.74s]  Originally, they were broken up into three classes, Class A, Class B, and Class C. Each
[7.74s -> 11.84s]  class separated an IP address into two parts, network and host. The network part of the
[11.84s -> 16.56s]  address denoted an administrative domain, such as MIT, BBN, or Stanford University.
[16.56s -> 20.82s]  The host part of the address denoted which device on that network. Class A addresses
[20.82s -> 26.00s]  had a leading zero, 7 bits of network, for 128 networks, and 24 bits of host,
[26.00s -> 30.68s]  so a Class A could cover 16 million computers. Class B addresses had 16 bits of host, so
[30.68s -> 36.36s]  it could cover 65,536 computers. Class C addresses had 8 bits of host, so it could
[36.36s -> 39.44s]  cover 256 computers.
[39.44s -> 43.60s]  While classes A, B, and C are simple, we quickly found out they were not flexible
[43.60s -> 48.00s]  enough. For example, both MIT and Stanford received one of the first Class A address
[48.00s -> 53.20s]  blocks, over 4 million addresses. For a while, MIT would give each of its dorms the
[53.20s -> 58.48s]  equivalent of Class Bâ€”65,000 addresses for a few hundred people at most. When IP
[58.48s -> 61.72s]  addresses were plentiful, this wasn't a problem, but as their use increased, we needed
[61.72s -> 63.84s]  a better allocation policy.
[63.84s -> 69.16s]  Useful note, Stanford gave up its Class A block in 1999. MIT still has its.
[69.16s -> 74.44s]  Today, IPv4 addresses are structured through something called CIDR, or Classless Interdomain
[74.44s -> 79.88s]  Routing. Rather than have prefixes only of length 8, 16, and 24 bits, CIDR allows
[79.92s -> 85.96s]  prefixes to be any number of bits. This means all CIDR prefixes define a block of addresses
[85.96s -> 90.38s]  that is a power of 2 in size. When we talk about CIDR addresses, we refer to its net
[90.38s -> 95.24s]  mask length. So, for example, when we talk about a slash 16, we mean a net mask of
[95.24s -> 102.24s]  length 16. This CIDR block describes 2 to the 16 addresses, or 65,536 addresses. When
[102.96s -> 108.24s]  we talk about a slash 20, we mean a net mask of length 20. This CIDR block describes
[108.24s -> 115.24s]  2 to the 12 addresses, or 4,096 addresses. CIDR blocks are how addresses are structured,
[115.24s -> 122.24s]  addressed, and managed today. Today, Stanford has 5 slash 16 blocks, about 325,000 IPv4
[123.04s -> 123.64s]  addresses.
[123.64s -> 129.56s]  So how are IPv4 addresses allocated and managed? There's an organization called IANA for the
[129.56s -> 133.20s]  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. The ultimate authority is ICANN, the Internet
[133.20s -> 138.20s]  Corporation for the Assignment of Names and Numbers. ICANN delegates the work to IANA.
[138.24s -> 143.32s]  IANA gives out slash 8s, describing 16 million addresses, to regional Internet registries
[143.32s -> 149.84s]  called RIRs. Each continent has its own RIR. The RIR for the United States is ARIN, while
[149.84s -> 155.58s]  the RIR for the Western Pacific is APNIC. These RIRs each have their own policy for
[155.58s -> 159.48s]  how they break up the slash 8s into smaller blocks of addresses and assign them to parties
[159.48s -> 163.60s]  who need them. You might have read in the news that we have run out of IP addresses.
[163.60s -> 168.34s]  This isn't true. There are many unused addresses today. What did happen is that IANA
[168.34s -> 173.24s]  ran out of slash 8s to give out, reached a special end case in its charter. When
[173.24s -> 180.16s]  reduced to its last 5 slash 8 blocks, IANA gave one slash 8 to each RIR. Now address
[180.16s -> 183.16s]  management and allocation is up to the RIRs.
[183.16s -> 186.54s]  In 2012, John Peterson, who is then a member of the Internet Architecture Board, gave
[186.54s -> 190.20s]  a talk at Stanford on some of the political, economic, and technical complications that
[190.20s -> 194.48s]  this raises. This talk isn't required material for the course, but I recommend it highly
[194.48s -> 197.80s]  and you should be able to find it on the website.
[197.80s -> 202.24s]  So now you've seen the structure of IPv4 addresses, how they're allocated, and how
[202.24s -> 206.32s]  n-hosts make their first top-ranking decisions, that is, whether to send to a local node
[206.32s -> 209.56s]  or to their gateway router. Addresses today are managed in terms of
[209.56s -> 214.20s]  sider blocks, whose size is defined by their prefix length. A shorter prefix, say
[214.20s -> 218.72s]  a slash 8, is a larger block than a longer prefix, say a slash 10.
