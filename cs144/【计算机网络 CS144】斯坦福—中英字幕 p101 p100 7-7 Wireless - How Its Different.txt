[0.00s -> 4.00s]  wireless networking, and why wireless systems turn out to, in practice, be
[4.00s -> 9.00s]  really different than wired ones. One of the big challenges you see today on the
[9.00s -> 13.00s]  internet is we all want to connect wirelessly, yet there have been a lot of
[13.00s -> 17.00s]  assumptions made, historically, that networks would behave like wired ones,
[17.00s -> 21.00s]  and actually bridging that to wireless is often difficult, which is why we see
[21.00s -> 24.00s]  poor performance, say, on your laptop using Wi-Fi. So in this video, I'm
[24.00s -> 27.00s]  going to talk really about why is wireless different? What are these
[27.00s -> 31.00s]  properties that make it so challenging and so difficult, and why does it seem,
[31.00s -> 35.00s]  sometimes seem to be flaky? So in the context of this video, I'm going to
[35.00s -> 41.00s]  focus on access point networks, and by that I mean wireless networks where, you
[41.00s -> 50.00s]  know, say you have your laptop with some Wi-Fi card. And it connects to some
[50.00s -> 58.00s]  access point, which then has a wired connection to the internet. And this
[58.00s -> 65.00s]  access point is serving, you know, it's often multiple devices, like here's your
[65.00s -> 71.00s]  phone. This is different than, say, a mobile phone network or, you know, 3G or
[71.00s -> 76.00s]  4G, which are managed very differently, much more tightly controlled, all kinds
[76.00s -> 81.00s]  of different issues emerge in those systems. Here I'm just going to focus on
[81.00s -> 85.00s]  open, open standards, access point networks, you know, things which you just
[85.00s -> 89.00s]  plug in at home, connect to your wired connection to bridge to the broader
[89.00s -> 93.00s]  internet. So one of the first things to realize about wireless is that, unlike
[93.00s -> 97.00s]  in a wired network, where the medium, the wire, is completely under control,
[97.00s -> 101.00s]  control, there's nobody fighting you for the capacity of that wire, it's for you
[102.00s -> 106.00s]  In the wireless environment, you're using space, right? You're using the
[106.00s -> 109.00s]  electromagnetic spectrum around you, which everyone else might be wanting to
[109.00s -> 114.00s]  use as well. It's not a controlled medium, it's a shared medium. And so in
[114.00s -> 118.00s]  practice, what this means is that it is very tightly regulated. So this is a
[118.00s -> 123.00s]  map of how, just in the United States, radio spectrum is allocated. So radio
[123.00s -> 127.00s]  spectrum, here's kind of the big picture of, of RF, or not of RF, but of
[128.00s -> 132.00s]  electromagnetic spectrums, down from very low frequency stuff, all the way up to
[132.00s -> 136.00s]  cosmic rays. That's this big thing down at the bottom. So this is, you can get
[136.00s -> 139.00s]  this from the US Department of Commerce, this is a free government document.
[139.00s -> 143.00s]  And so generally data communication is occurring in this region down here,
[143.00s -> 147.00s]  different kinds of communication, either data communication, voice communication,
[147.00s -> 152.00s]  et cetera. Up above, what's in this picture here, this yellow region, is
[152.00s -> 158.00s]  red. Then here's visible light here. So, here's visible light, here's
[158.00s -> 164.00s]  ultraviolet, x-rays, gamma rays, et cetera. But RF is down here, so below
[164.00s -> 169.00s]  visible light, lower frequencies. And here's what the spectrum looks like. And
[169.00s -> 173.00s]  so you can see there's a huge chunk of spectrum where it's going all the
[173.00s -> 177.00s]  way from three kilohertz, so when you have 3,000 waves per second, up to
[177.00s -> 183.00s]  300 gigahertz, or 300 billion waves per second. So if you recall, if given that
[183.00s -> 189.00s]  RF, or that electromagnetic radiation moves at one foot per nanosecond, at three
[189.00s -> 195.00s]  kilohertz, you're looking at waves that are on the order of 300,000 sorry,
[195.00s -> 201.00s]  yeah, 300,000 feet long. Whereas down to the 300 gigahertz range, you're
[201.00s -> 206.00s]  looking at waves that are one three hundredth of a foot long. So a huge,
[206.00s -> 211.00s]  huge range of frequencies for all kinds of things. You know, there's TV, there's
[211.00s -> 215.00s]  radio, there's data communication, there are maritime systems, there are military
[215.00s -> 220.00s]  systems, there are satellites, et cetera. But when we talk about access point
[220.00s -> 226.00s]  networks, and modern data communication systems, we're talking about these three,
[226.00s -> 235.00s]  these four narrow chunks. So, these green ones are telephony. And
[236.00s -> 241.00s]  So it's down the 800, 900 megahertz range, 700, this is the 1.9. Telephony,
[241.00s -> 246.00s]  WiMAX and stuff is starting to move up, but basically 3G standards are down here.
[246.00s -> 254.00s]  And these two blocks here, these two red blocks, this is Wi-Fi. And so when you
[254.00s -> 260.00s]  think about all of the data communication that we use today, phones
[260.00s -> 265.00s]  laptops, it's all squished into these two, these four tiny little slices. Now the
[265.00s -> 269.00s]  really important thing to realize about wireless is that, as you can imagine,
[269.00s -> 273.00s]  wireless transmission is not a wire. The wireless medium is not a wire. And
[273.00s -> 277.00s]  what this means is that, unlike something propagated on a wire where
[277.00s -> 282.00s]  there's some attenuation or there's some resistance in the copper, a wireless
[282.00s -> 286.00s]  signal is radiating over space. Like in the simplest, if you have a perfect
[286.00s -> 292.00s]  omnidirectional antenna, it's radiating in a sphere out. And what this means is
[292.00s -> 298.00s]  that the signal strength degrades with distance at r squared or faster, right?
[298.00s -> 303.00s]  A signal, when you are twice as far away from a transmitter, the signal is
[303.00s -> 308.00s]  at least attenuated by 75%. It's at a quarter of the strength, just because
[308.00s -> 313.00s]  think of the surface of a sphere. And so what this means is that, unlike in a
[313.00s -> 316.00s]  wireless system where we can know, oh, well, the cable, as long as it's good and
[316.00s -> 319.00s]  it's not longer than 100 meters, we're gonna have a strong, strong signal
[319.00s -> 322.00s]  strength. In wireless systems, you often have very weak signal strengths.
[322.00s -> 325.00s]  In fact, people are gonna try and get all the way to the edge because they
[325.00s -> 328.00s]  wanna be sitting out, you know, on the lawn using their Wi-Fi access
[328.00s -> 332.00s]  point. Furthermore, unlike a wire where it's tightly controlled, there's nobody
[332.00s -> 336.00s]  doing stuff, wireless is out in the world around you. So it can be that
[336.00s -> 340.00s]  somebody steps between you and your access point. Now suddenly, all these
[340.00s -> 344.00s]  wireless signals have to go through that person, they're a big bag of water, the
[344.00s -> 347.00s]  wireless is gonna become much, much weaker. And so the signal strength is
[347.00s -> 351.00s]  gonna change significantly over time as people open doors, people move around,
[351.00s -> 355.00s]  as you move around, as the humidity changes. Furthermore, there, everyone else
[355.00s -> 358.00s]  is using the medium as well. There's lots of interference. It's not like you
[358.00s -> 362.00s]  have this wire to yourself. Instead, you know, the person next door might be
[362.00s -> 366.00s]  using their wireless network, which is on the same frequency. So let's look
[366.00s -> 370.00s]  at the diversity of signal strength. So, the problem here is that there are
[370.00s -> 374.00s]  obstructions in the real world, and they can move around, and they weaken the
[374.00s -> 378.00s]  signal. If you stand behind a metal plate, your wireless signal will be much
[378.00s -> 382.00s]  weaker than if you stood in front of it. Furthermore, wireless signals reflect.
[382.00s -> 388.00s]  And so, it can be that I'm standing, you know, in some hallway here with my
[388.00s -> 395.00s]  laptop, and there's an access point here. And it might be that the signal I get
[395.00s -> 400.00s]  is some weird reflection off of different media, off of different walls.
[400.00s -> 405.00s]  And the trick here is that, in practice, this means that, for example, here I'm
[405.00s -> 409.00s]  getting this reflection, but I'm also getting a direct signal, say, through these
[409.00s -> 413.00s]  walls, is that unlike in a wire, in a wireless environment, you can have
[413.00s -> 416.00s]  something called multipath, that you're getting this signal, but you're getting
[416.00s -> 420.00s]  multiple copies of it across different paths with different delays. Think of it
[420.00s -> 424.00s]  like echoes in a canyon, where there's the direct sound you hear, but then all
[424.00s -> 428.00s]  of these echoes taking different paths reflecting off the walls of the canyon.
[428.00s -> 432.00s]  There's no perfectly uniform antenna, so if you move a little to the left, it
[432.00s -> 436.00s]  could be that that antenna's no good, and that's actually much weaker where
[436.00s -> 440.00s]  you are, so suddenly the signal goes down and you lose connection. Furthermore,
[440.00s -> 444.00s]  all these things are continuously changing. You can imagine, you move a little bit,
[444.00s -> 448.00s]  and suddenly the multipath changes, the reflections change. You can imagine I
[448.00s -> 451.00s]  move a little bit, the antenna's a little different, it's oriented
[451.00s -> 455.00s]  differently, and so things are dynamically changing. The environment
[455.00s -> 459.00s]  around you, it's not controlled. It could be somebody closes their office
[459.00s -> 463.00s]  door and suddenly your wireless signal goes out. Just to give you a sense as to
[463.00s -> 467.00s]  what this looks like, so this is some data collected by a student of mine, who's
[467.00s -> 471.00s]  now faculty at Ohio State, come on. And what it's showing you is signal
[471.00s -> 475.00s]  strength, over time, down here on the bottom, what's called the received
[475.00s -> 479.00s]  signal strength indicator, signal strength. And then at the top, the observed
[479.00s -> 484.00s]  packet reception ratios. This is for an 802.15.4 length that he measured. And so,
[484.00s -> 488.00s]  the transmitter is stationary, the receiver is stationary, and for every
[488.00s -> 493.00s]  packet he received, he logged what was the received signal strength, and then he
[493.00s -> 497.00s]  was observing what percentage of packets were received over time. This red line
[497.00s -> 501.00s]  shows the long-term average of this communication. It's actually pretty good,
[501.00s -> 505.00s]  around 93%. What we can see is that over the space of just a couple of
[506.00s -> 510.00s]  seconds, the signal strength is pretty solid up at 84 dBm, that's the units. You
[510.00s -> 514.00s]  know, it drops down a little bit, things get a little worse, drops down,
[514.00s -> 519.00s]  and then suddenly it drops, and just drops by around six, or about eight
[519.00s -> 524.00s]  dBm, or around eight dB. So we're on a factor of, of ten or so, five, five to
[524.00s -> 529.00s]  ten. And then what happens is that, that is below the signal strength at which
[529.00s -> 533.00s]  this device can receive packets, so the packet reception ratio drops to
[534.00s -> 539.00s]  zero percent. For a short period, then it comes up and starts receiving packets
[539.00s -> 544.00s]  again. And so just over the space of here of ten seconds or so, we see that a
[544.00s -> 549.00s]  link is going from, you know, 99%, down to 80%, down to 85%, back up to
[549.00s -> 553.00s]  90%, down to zero percent, to 70. You see these significant changes over
[553.00s -> 557.00s]  time. And so somehow your network, think about TCP, think about all these
[557.00s -> 561.00s]  retransmission schemes, has to deal with this kind of behavior. So here
[562.00s -> 566.00s]  I'm going to show you, in fact, a real-time video of a network we had
[566.00s -> 570.00s]  deployed here at Stanford called SWAN, the Stanford Wireless Access Network.
[570.00s -> 575.00s]  It's an 802.11 BG testbed, so Wi-Fi. And it's around 25 nodes or so. And
[575.00s -> 579.00s]  essentially, what I'm going to show you is what this network will collect
[579.00s -> 584.00s]  over 2.5 seconds. So this is in a time step to 25 milliseconds. There's
[584.00s -> 588.00s]  100 time steps. And each of these is a node. Gates is a computer science
[588.00s -> 592.00s]  department. Packet is the EE department. There's this street in between,
[592.00s -> 598.00s]  Saramal. And I'm going to show you what this network looked like over time.
[598.00s -> 602.00s]  So for each node, there are lines between nodes which show you the
[602.00s -> 606.00s]  packet reception ratio here of those links. A dark line means that all the
[606.00s -> 610.00s]  packets are received. And a very light line or a no line means that no packets
[610.00s -> 617.00s]  or very few packets are received. So watch what's happening with these links.
[617.00s -> 621.00s]  How quickly they're changing. And remember, this is 2.5 seconds. And so we
[621.00s -> 626.00s]  can see links are coming and going. They're changing, you know, in the space
[626.00s -> 629.00s]  of 25 milliseconds or less. Like, look at this link here and how it's
[629.00s -> 633.00s]  oscillating between 80% and 10% back and forth. And look at the links
[633.00s -> 638.00s]  between the two. So the point here is that in wireless networks like Wi-Fi
[638.00s -> 642.00s]  networks, they're highly, highly dynamic. So in addition to this issue of
[642.00s -> 645.00s]  just signal strength changing over time, there's also the issue of
[645.00s -> 648.00s]  interference. So a lot of wireless communication today is occurring in
[648.00s -> 651.00s]  unlicensed, like Wi-Fi. Its access point networks occur in unlicensed bands,
[651.00s -> 654.00s]  bands that don't require a license from the government. Anyone can use this
[654.00s -> 658.00s]  band. And that's why they're, they're so popular, cuz they're free. But
[658.00s -> 662.00s]  then lots and lots of different technologies share the bands. So here's
[662.00s -> 666.00s]  a map, for example, of just what's going on in the 2.4 basically the 2.5
[666.00s -> 672.00s]  gigahertz range. This is Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi's lower frequency. So you can see,
[672.00s -> 677.00s]  here's Wi-Fi 802.11b in these different ranges. Here you can see it's bandwidth
[677.00s -> 681.00s]  of 22 megahertz. Here's channels one, six, and eleven. But at the same
[681.00s -> 686.00s]  frequency ranges, there's 802.15.4 Zigbee, a low power wireless system,
[686.00s -> 690.00s]  which is using the same range of frequencies. Bluetooth uses the same
[690.00s -> 694.00s]  range of frequencies. So this means that something in 802.11 can receive
[694.00s -> 698.00s]  interference with something in 802.15.4 and vice versa. These are challenges
[698.00s -> 702.00s]  that all these systems have to deal with, that they might have good signal, they
[702.00s -> 705.00s]  might have low noise, but then someone's interfering with them. And so, for
[705.00s -> 709.00s]  example, if you just look at what wireless activity is like over time, this
[709.00s -> 714.00s]  is this nice graph which Om Prakash Kunalwali, he's now a professor at
[714.00s -> 721.00s]  University of Houston generated. This is taken at this data from USC which is
[721.00s -> 727.00s]  where he used to be a student, PhD student. And you can see, look at all
[727.00s -> 730.00s]  this Wi-Fi activity. So here's time in seconds from zero to two minutes, and
[730.00s -> 734.00s]  different Wi-Fi channels one to eleven. You can see that these channels one and
[734.00s -> 738.00s]  eleven are really, really busy, where orange is showing lots and lots of Wi-Fi
[738.00s -> 741.00s]  activity. And so the lessons to take away here is that wireless networks are
[741.00s -> 744.00s]  becoming increasingly important. We'd much rather just connect to the internet
[744.00s -> 748.00s]  wirelessly rather than plug a wire into our, our laptop. But generally,
[748.00s -> 752.00s]  they don't work as well. They're less reliable, they're more flaky, and
[752.00s -> 756.00s]  this is because of the fact that they're in this shared medium that's
[756.00s -> 760.00s]  controlled. Lots of different devices are using it, the environment's changing
[760.00s -> 765.00s]  around them and there's lots of interference. And so, in practice, what
[765.00s -> 771.00s]  this means is that to try to get wireless to be, you know, good enough as,
[771.00s -> 776.00s]  to be usable do these different properties and different behaviors,
[776.00s -> 781.00s]  wireless actually ends up using very different algorithms and protocols. So,
[781.00s -> 785.00s]  wireless link layers look different than wired link layers. Wireless media
[785.00s -> 789.00s]  access control systems look different than wired ones. So this next series of
[789.00s -> 792.00s]  videos is going to go into some of those differences and explain how
[792.00s -> 794.00s]  wireless today works.
