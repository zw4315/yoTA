[0.00s -> 6.08s]  Here's a quiz. For this quiz, assume there is no other documentation of the TCB finite
[6.08s -> 12.80s]  state machines. There is no supporting textual description which defines other state transitions.
[12.80s -> 17.80s]  In this first question, suppose the finite state machine starts in the closed state.
[17.80s -> 22.72s]  Then the user program calls listen on the socket. The socket receives a SYN message.
[22.72s -> 26.88s]  Before any other event arrives, the user program calls closed. What state will the
[26.88s -> 29.30s]  socket be in?
[29.30s -> 33.54s]  For this second question, suppose the finite state machine starts in the closed state.
[33.54s -> 37.66s]  Then the user program calls connect. Before any other event arrives, the user program
[37.66s -> 40.42s]  calls close. What state will the socket be in?
