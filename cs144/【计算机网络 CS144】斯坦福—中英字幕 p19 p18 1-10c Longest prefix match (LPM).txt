[0.00s -> 9.30s]  The answer for 63.19.5.3 is link 3. 63.19.5.3 matches two prefixes, the default route and
[9.30s -> 17.40s]  prefix 63.19.5.0. The prefix is 30 bits long and 63.19.5.3 differs in only the last
[17.40s -> 24.30s]  two bits. Flash 30 is a longer prefix than slash 0, so the router will pick link 3.
[24.30s -> 32.70s]  The answer for B, 171.15.15.0, is link 4. B matches three entries. It matches the default
[32.70s -> 47.10s]  route 171.0.0.0.8 and 171.0.0.0.10. It does not match 171.0.15.0.24 because B's second
[47.10s -> 56.70s]  octet is 15, not 0. The third match, 171.0.0.0.10, is the longest prefix, 10 bits, so the router
[56.70s -> 63.90s]  sends the packet along link 4. The answer for C, 63.19.5.32, is link 1. The longest
[63.90s -> 69.90s]  prefix matches the default route. It does not match 63.19.5.0 because it differs in
[69.90s -> 77.30s]  the 26th bit. The answer for D, 44.199.230.1, is link 1. The longest prefix match is the
[77.30s -> 86.60s]  default route. The answer for E, 171.128.16.0, is link 2. This address matches two prefixes,
[86.60s -> 94.80s]  the default route and 171.0.0.0.8. It does not match 171.0.0.0.10 because it differs
[94.80s -> 101.80s]  in the 9th bit. 171.0.0.0.8 is the longest prefix, so the router will forward this packet
[101.80s -> 102.70s]  on link 2.
