[0.00s -> 5.52s]  So, in this unit, we're going to be learning about network security.
[5.52s -> 9.32s]  Usually when we read about the internet and networks in the newspaper, it's because of
[9.32s -> 13.28s]  some security vulnerability that's been exploited or found.
[13.28s -> 17.72s]  Of course, we read about them in these exploits in software, but sometimes you read
[17.72s -> 20.84s]  about them in the infrastructure itself.
[20.84s -> 25.98s]  And these are usually exposed because an individual, a company, or a country is attacking someone
[25.98s -> 32.10s]  in order to be able to discover or tamper with their data.
[32.10s -> 35.56s]  We're going to start by learning about the types of attack that are quite common.
[35.56s -> 38.54s]  There are many ways to attack a network, and you're going to be seeing a collection
[38.54s -> 41.66s]  of methods that work in a variety of different ways.
[41.66s -> 45.98s]  The first and most common one is to simply eavesdrop or listen on someone else's communication.
[45.98s -> 50.30s]  In some networks, this is surprisingly easy, and you're going to be surprised at some
[50.30s -> 52.50s]  of the methods that are used and can be used.
[52.62s -> 56.22s]  And we'll even demonstrate some of these to you.
[56.22s -> 60.30s]  You can either eavesdrop on a broadcast network, like a wireless network, or you can
[60.30s -> 67.38s]  force the network to expose or broadcast in a way that will make it easier for you to hear.
[67.38s -> 73.54s]  Another type of attack is to masquerade or behave as if you're a piece of the infrastructure
[73.54s -> 77.34s]  that is providing information back to a sending host.
[77.34s -> 80.94s]  For example, you can forge up responses.
[81.78s -> 87.66s]  You can spoof the response from a DHCP server or from a DNS server and cause the client
[87.66s -> 91.70s]  to send data to a place other than it was thinking of sending it.
[91.70s -> 96.90s]  So you can either get the data redirected to you, where you can look at it and then
[96.90s -> 102.34s]  pass it on, which is often called a man-in-the-middle attack, or you can make it impossible
[102.34s -> 106.42s]  for the sender to communicate with a particular part of the network and essentially censor
[106.42s -> 108.90s]  or block a portion of the network.
[108.90s -> 115.62s]  Sometimes you're actually able to hijack an entire end host and masquerade as an end host
[115.62s -> 119.74s]  and therefore completely terminate the communication, for example, to get someone's credit card
[119.74s -> 123.46s]  information when they're performing any kind of e-commerce transaction.
[123.46s -> 127.74s]  Another thing that you can do is to prevent someone from being able to communicate at all.
[127.74s -> 132.58s]  This is usually called a denial of service attack by overwhelming the sender or overwhelming
[132.58s -> 137.38s]  a piece of the infrastructure so that the communication can no longer take place.
[137.38s -> 141.10s]  So the internet is dangerous. We're going to learn the three principles that you can
[141.10s -> 146.54s]  use to actually secure your network, despite the fact that the internet itself might be insecure.
[146.54s -> 151.30s]  The first is confidentiality. It's the idea that we'd like to be able to communicate
[151.30s -> 155.82s]  securely, that is, hidden from everyone else, despite the fact that they might be able
[155.82s -> 159.70s]  to see what we're saying. And so if you have confidentiality, then you can communicate
[159.70s -> 163.34s]  with another party, other people can observe this communication but not be able to know
[163.34s -> 165.42s]  what you're saying.
[165.46s -> 169.82s]  The second principle is integrity. So confidentiality lets us communicate with other people
[169.82s -> 173.10s]  who know what we're saying, but people can still meddle with it. With integrity,
[173.10s -> 177.06s]  we can be sure that our communications aren't tampered with, such that the message
[177.06s -> 180.74s]  said that Nick sent to me was actually the message that Nick sent to me. It wasn't
[180.74s -> 184.10s]  that somebody fussed with it in between.
[184.10s -> 188.98s]  The third principle is authenticity. Can I actually be sure that the other party I'm
[188.98s -> 194.18s]  talking with is whom they say they are? It turns out there are some ways to do this.
[194.22s -> 199.34s]  So the basic techniques for both confidentiality and integrity and authenticity that you use
[199.34s -> 205.22s]  is cryptography. So mathematical tools and secrecy in codes. The idea is that if we use
[205.22s -> 210.70s]  the right cryptographic tools, then we can have secure communication even over an insecure
[210.70s -> 214.58s]  network like the internet. And so you're going to learn about some basic cryptographic
[214.58s -> 219.78s]  tools such as cryptographic hashes, message authentication codes, symmetric ciphers, public
[219.78s -> 225.66s]  key cryptography, certificates and signatures, which are all used in the internet today.
[225.66s -> 228.90s]  And so by the end of this unit, you should start to have a sense as to how you should
[228.90s -> 230.62s]  secure your network going forward.
